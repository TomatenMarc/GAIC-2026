Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Justin Post with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please state your question.
Justin Post: Thank you. Just a follow-up on India and China. I know you are investing a lot. I'd love to hear how much, but you probably won't tell us. But can you tell us why you think the market is worth investment and what really attracts you to the market as you think out longer-term? And then China, can you give us any updates there on how financial performance is doing and if you've changed your strategy and if anything has gotten better there this year? Thank you.
Brian T. Olsavsky: Sure. Let me start with India. So, it's still very early. We continue to say that, but we are very encouraged with what we've created with customers and sellers alike in India over the last few years. We continue to develop new functionality for that country, whether it's delivery, whether it's seller features. We rolled out Prime last summer if you'll remember, and we recently launched Prime Video there. So we've had success with [technical difficulty] (10:55) we've been in. We don't expect India to be any different. We will continue to build our business there and continue to do a great job for both customers and sellers. We're bullish on India longer-term and it's early. But we like the initial engagement we're seeing and the response from, again, both customers and sellers.
Darin Manney: Yes, and this is Darin. On China, like I said, we're very pleased with our offering in China. Our strategy there has been one of bringing a trusted and authentic product to customers in China, both domestically and from international offers. So we'll continue to focus on the Global Store there. As you may know, we've launched the Prime program that's focused around the availability of international goods in China and that we're pleased with what we're seeing there.
