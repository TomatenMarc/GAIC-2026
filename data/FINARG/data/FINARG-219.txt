Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
Douglas T. Anmuth: Thanks for taking the question. I just want to ask you about CapEx. It looks like CapEx including leases more than doubled year-over-year. So I know you listed kind of a long list of the many investment opportunities here, but can you just point out anything else in particular that drove the pretty substantial increase there? Thank you.
Brian T. Olsavsky: Sure. Yes, the CapEx, which is principally the fulfillment centers was – grew 51% year-over-year. As you'll remember, we added 26 warehouses last – fulfillment centers last year, 23 in the second half of the year. Some of that cost of start-up is before the start-up some comes in a quarter afterwards. So there was some carryover from that. But generally, the biggest trend here is that the differential between Amazon fulfilled network unit growth and paid unit growth. So that nearly 40% growth in Amazon fulfilled units last year, and the continuation of the strong growth higher than the paid unit growth that we see in 2017 is resulting in a lot of fulfillment center capacity. And the fulfillment centers I'll also say with the robotics technology tend to be more capital intensive than prior versions of warehouses, and then they generally have much better operating efficiencies and variable costs following their start-up. On the capital leases, that grew 45%. A good deal of that is tied to the AWS business. As I just mentioned, a lot of that is tied to usage growth. But a caution; CapEx can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, and if you look back to last year, the trailing 12 months was only 7% growth from the quarters through Q1 of last year. So certainly it was a bigger step-up in 2016 now carrying into 2017.
