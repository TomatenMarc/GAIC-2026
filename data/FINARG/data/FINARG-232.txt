Operator: Your next question is from Justin Post with Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
Justin Post: Great. Thank you. I think on the call, you said times spent was 46 minutes per day. Any comparable metric from past quarters? And then how would you, if you can give us that, how would you gauge the overall engagement of Facebook just for the core site? Maybe some help about what you're seeing there and what products are really having an impact. Thank you.
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg: Well, I think in terms of engagement the product is having, the biggest impact is News Feed continuing to do very well. So News Feed at the core is proving to be just a great experience for users. It's getting better. We continue to invest in that. As people spend more time with News Feed, we get better about understanding what they like and getting the content that they care about in front of them. So we're investing on that front. We're also doing more with public content. That's having an impact. So we're seeing across the board good improvements to News Feed. Video is another big contributor there as well. So, I mean, that's what we're seeing in terms of driving engagement. Engagement across the different regions as we think about it from a DAU-to-MAU perspective was at record levels in the quarter, so we're pleased with that. And we continue to see time spent grow across the platform. So on all those measures, we really like what we're seeing and we like the investments that we're making to make that News Feed experience even better.
