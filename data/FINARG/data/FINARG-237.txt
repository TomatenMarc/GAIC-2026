Operator: [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question is coming from analyst Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.
Stephen Ju: Hey, thanks. So Brian, I think in the past you've given some indication as to what usage growth may be at AWS. I was wondering if you have an update for that in the fourth quarter. And secondarily, is there any way to characterize what the pricing environment is right now for AWS as well? Thank you.
Brian Olsavsky: Yes, thanks, Stephen. No, I don't have a usage growth number for you. We'll say we're - it's been very strong. And AWS revenue is on a, just short of a $10 billion run rate at the end of Q4. As far as pricing is concerned, we had a price reduction in January for our EC2 services. It was our 51st price reduction since we launched AWS years ago. And generally what we find is that price is important. But so is speed and agility for customers and the ability to deliver services and features that were beneficial to them. I will point out that we added 722 new features and services in 2015 and that was up 40% year-over-year. So we feel we have a lead in this space and we don't take it for granted and we want to serve customers better each year.
Stephen Ju: Thank you.
