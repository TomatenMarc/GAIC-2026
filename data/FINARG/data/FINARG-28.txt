Operator: Our next question comes from Neil Doshi with Mizuho Securities.
Neil A. Doshi: Great. Thanks, guys. Can you talk a little bit more about India and what's kind of the opportunity there that you see, there's a tremendous amount of – tremendous middle class there. But the distribution can be very challenging. So is that an area where we could see Amazon really building out the last mile? And then there's been some reports of an Amazon potentially trying to close the gap in terms of delivery and deliver sooner. On the grocery side, what's the impetus there? And can we see how the recent markets have been trending on the grocery side that you've launched recently? Thank you.
Brian T. Olsavsky: I'll take the India question. So again, India is a different market and does not have a lot of the same ready fulfillment options that some other countries did. We see that as an opportunity, an opportunity that we can build and we can bring to sellers. And as I believe I already mentioned, we like what we see. We're very encouraged. Customer accounts, active customer accounts are up 230% year-over-year and sellers – number of sellers is up 250% year-over-year. 90% of those sellers use our logistics and warehouse services, as you mentioned, which has caused us to triple our fulfillment capacity. And we're happy to do so. We like what we see in India. We think we have – we're attractive both to customers and to sellers and we like our position.
Phil Hardin: This is Phil. So, on the grocery side, for fresh we're in a handful of metropolitan areas here in the U.S. It's been a relatively measured rollout by Amazon standards. We continue to work on the customer experience and making sure we're really delivering a quality experience for shoppers. And we're also working on the economics. And so we continue to work on that, but not much new to add right now.
