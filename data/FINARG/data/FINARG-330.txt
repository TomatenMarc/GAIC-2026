Operator: Our next question comes from Carlos Kirjner with Bernstein. Please state your question.
Carlos Kirjner-Neto: Thank you. I have two. I think it's the first time since 1Q 2011 that we see tech and content as a percentage of revenue declining or flat. Is this just a sign of your inability to increase investment in line with revenue growth? Or is there something else going on and if yes, what? And secondly, Brian, you said that the growth of Prime has been driven by investments you have made and are making. And you gave the examples of devices that you guys are selling. I think it's a mathematical certainty that Prime subscribers will decelerate in North America at some point from 50% growth. As penetration increases and growth slows, will we see a deceleration in the investment levels? And in other words, how do we think about the effect of deceleration in Prime on the North American margin structure in the future? Thank you.
Brian T. Olsavsky: Sure. Let me start with that second one. So we think there's a lot of room to grow in not only our international countries, but also in the U.S. So we plan on continuing to build the benefits of the Prime program from music to video, to two-day shipping, to same-day shipping, to Prime Now. So I don't see that dissipating. And again, it remains the best deal in retail. So hopefully everyone signs up for that. On the tech and content question, I don't have a lot to call out in the quarter. I would say there's no let-up in the pace of invention here, particularly on the AWS side. We usually quote the number of new features and services to you each quarter, we had 214 in Q1, up from 170 the first quarter of last year. So over 26% growth in this quarter alone coming off a year where I believe the number was 722 significant new features and services delivered for AWS customers last year.
