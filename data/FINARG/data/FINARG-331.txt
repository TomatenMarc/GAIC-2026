Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citi. Please proceed with your question.
Walter Pritchard: Hi, thanks. Satya, I’m wondering if you can talk about, you’re seeing some progress on the cloud gross margins and you’re also investing pretty heavily. And I’m wondering how important it is for you kind of medium to long-term to be able to get things like Bing, Xbox LIVE and Office 365 running on the same infrastructure as Azure in terms of getting the kind of sale you want and ultimately driving the margins to where you want it to get to; is that sort of a prerequisite to get to where you’d like those margins to be?
Satya Nadella: Yes. I mean it’s absolute perquisite for us to have entirety of our cloud infrastructure plant drive scale economics for us. And in fact, a lot of the core Azure technology around machine management and data center management comes out of our bring efforts. We manage all of the supply chain, all of it is as one supply chain; we do SKU design as one SKU design; we drive costs of both network storage, compute down altogether. In fact you should think of Azure as the common fabric of all our applications. And you look at even some of our games like Halo, a significant usage of our cloud. And that’s what’s really driving some of the economics. In fact the first -- the fact that -- I celebrate the fact that we don’t have just one first party workload because it’s very easy for one first party workload to completely opt if you will the architecture of a cloud. But in our case, we have a very diverse set of workload. We have Xbox LIVE; we have Office 365; we have Dynamics and Bing and that diversity is what allows us to build in fact for our own needs a cloud architecture that then can meet many more workloads and that’s working pretty well for us.
Walter Pritchard: Got it. Thank you.
Chris Suh: Thanks very much. We’ll take the next question please.
