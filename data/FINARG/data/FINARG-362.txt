Operator: You next question is from the line of John Blackledge with Cowen.
John Blackledge: Great, thanks. Two questions, on marketplace with the expansion to 30 countries, just wondering how the business model evolves over time, does it kind of mirror Amazon’s third-party business or eBay’s marketplace business? And then just on ad units, on the mid-roll video ad units. Just wondering I know it's early, just any color on the ad demand and perhaps how you think about the impact to this ad unit for the next couple of years? Thank you.
Sheryl Sandberg: On marketplace, we're just going to continue to iterate on the ad test. We're pretty encouraged by what we've seen even though it's pretty early days. What we're excited about is that our business is helping people connect with things they want to buy. It's also important to note that commerce is a really important vertical in our ad business. So it's not just the commerce is being driven in ads in marketplace. But in a much bigger way, commerce discovering product all the way, through to sales is a big part of what's driving our ads business. On Ad Breaks for mid-roll video, early days pretty good result, more than 70% of Ad Break up to 15 seconds in length on Facebook and Audience Network are being viewed to completion. Most are being viewed with the sound on. But again it's very early for this.
