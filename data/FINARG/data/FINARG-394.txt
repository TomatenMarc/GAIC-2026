Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Nathanson from MoffettNathanson.
Michael B. Nathanson: Thank you. I have one for Dave and one for Sheryl. Dave, going back to your prepared comments, I think you mentioned there was 24% growth in pricing this quarter, in unit pricing. Can you help us explain or understand underlying that growth which products you're seeing the greatest inflation maybe quarter over quarter or year over year?
David M. Wehner: I would really just point to the overall dynamics of the system. And again, what we're seeing is with slower supply growth, that's going to play out to higher pricing. And again, are we effective? And we've been effective at delivering good return on investment for our advertisers and getting better at converting what we have as inventory into what they care about as outcomes. And that from a systemic point of view is what's playing through there. From a product perspective, as we get things like Dynamic Product Ads rolled out, those are incredibly valuable. As we connect more advertisers with those and bring more data into the system and we can get more of the impressions that are very highly targeted and very relevant, then we'll be rewarded with better pricing as we can expand that out into things like Lookalikes. We've talked a lot about it on this call. That basically takes some of that really good targeting and extends that into a much bigger audience, and then we can get more impressions at better value because we're really connecting that with end results that the advertisers value. So it's really all that type of work that we do to get the system better and better, and so we're constantly working to get better penetration of these key ad products. In terms of the supply side, obviously News Feed is incredibly valuable because it's very present for the consumer. And we've improved the quality of the ads in News Feed, and that's another driver from the supply side.
