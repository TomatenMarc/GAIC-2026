Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.
Heather Bellini: Great. Thank you. I had two questions. One, I was just wondering what the advertiser response is then to the lower engagement and also just the kind of I guess cleaning up of the News Feed if you will. What’s kind of there view on this and also can you share with us any metrics on Watch and I know it's really early, but anything that interesting from an engagement perspective here and kind of how do you think this could evolve? Thank you.
Sheryl Sandberg: On the DAU impact any Advertiser response our business is strong. We have over 184 million people using Facebook everyday in the U.S., which is considerably more than the Super Bowl every day on mobile alone. We also have – we think the best stability to target and make advertising relevant for businesses and people who see ads. We're continuing to build the products that allow businesses to get a higher return for the dollars they spend and allow people to see more relevant information in ads on our platform. So we're pleased with the growth and we believe that that delivering the strong quarter we have shows that. On Watch, it’s just early days. We have a dedicated place for people to watch and comment, where heavily focused on the social aspects of video viewing, but it’s too early to report any really findings.
