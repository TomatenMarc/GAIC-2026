Operator: Your next question comes from John Blackledge with Cowen & Company.
John R Blackledge: Great. Thank you. It appears that Amazon is growing its share of household budget driven by many factors, Prime growth and strong growth in large verticals like apparel among others. Specifically on apparel, I'm just wondering how you view the breadth of Amazon's apparel offering. Any color on that segment's performance in the second quarter. And how do you view Amazon's apparel opportunity going forward? Thank you.
Brian T. Olsavsky: Yeah. Thanks for your question. We have not broken out specifically apparel, but we're super excited about that business. It's growing very well. We like our position in it. We think our website is very tuned to selling online. So we're very happy with that. It is a big business for us, not only in North America but also Internationally. You mentioned a couple other consumables categories. I will say we are very happy in our consumables and hard lines categories, as well. We drive a lot of repeat business with things like Prime Pantry and Subscribe and Save and others. So, very happy with the EGM business as a whole.
John R Blackledge: Thanks.
