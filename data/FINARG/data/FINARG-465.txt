Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thill from Jefferies.
Brent Thill: Thanks. Just on Europe, there's been a more pronounced deceleration. Just curious in terms of how you think about the stabilization there going forward in your model and maybe a little more color on the pricing.
David M. Wehner: Yeah. Hey, Brent. It's Dave. I think, I guess, if you're talking about DAU and MAU, Europe is stable on that front in terms of Facebook overall. The accounting methodology change did affect how Europe sequential growth rate came in, but really stable if you kind of take that aside. And we had some impact from GDPR over the last two quarters. So I think, from that perspective, it is broadly stable for Facebook there. European growth rate I think was healthy from a revenue point of view. So I think we're still seeing good growth in Europe on the revenue front, and a lot of the similar dynamics playing out in Europe as in the rest of the world where you see good impression growth opportunity, especially in areas like Instagram and Stories contributing to overall ability to drive revenue growth.
