Operator: The next question is from Justin Post with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
Justin Post: Hi, thanks for taking my call. Dave, could you clarify a bit on investment year, what that means? Does that mean expenses growing faster than revenues? And then I think Mark mentioned $250 million on content for VR. Anything else in there that we should be thinking about? And then maybe one housekeeping, ad blocking, could you quantify how much that might have helped desktop revenues? Thank you.
David M. Wehner: Justin, just on investment year, I'm not giving specific commentary around revenue growth versus expense growth. What I wanted to provide was just some color around our thinking about investment going into 2017. Obviously, on the CapEx side, we've got a number of projects underway on the data center front. So clearly on that front, we've got a lot of projects that are going to need ongoing funding going into 2017, so that we've got good visibility on. In addition, while it's too early to give specifics, I want to give some directional color around expense growth. We've already invested in accelerating our recruiting efforts, so I wanted to highlight that. That's primarily around technology, technical recruiting, software engineering, and we have a lot of opportunities that we see to invest in the long-term growth of the business. And so that's our plan going into 2017. On ad blocking, in terms of the impact, I would just point out that this quarter we had 18% year-over-year desktop revenue growth. If you look at recent quarters, it was about half of that growth rate on a year-over-year basis. So that increment, that acceleration in desktop revenue growth is largely due to our efforts on reducing the impact of ad blocking. So that's what led to the acceleration of desktop revenue growth.
