Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Colin Sebastian with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.
Colin Alan Sebastian: Great. Thank you. A question on the grocery category and the announcements that we have – that we heard recently. Specifically, does that imply that the strategy has changed around fresh, which was presumably replacing the trip to the grocery store? Or should we think about adding different modes such as pick up points and bricks and mortar as serving a distinct customer base or geared to reduce the cost bottleneck around home delivery? Any comments would be helpful. Thanks.
Brian T. Olsavsky: Sure, Colin. First, as far as Whole Foods is concerned, as Darin mentioned, it's not included in this guidance since it hasn't closed yet, but we are excited about that acquisition and looking forward to working with the team at Whole Foods. We think they are very customer-centric, just like us. They've built a great business, focus around quality and customer. So we're really glad to join up with them. On your larger question about what the place of Amazon Fresh, likely Prime Now and some of our other efforts, I would say we believe there'll be no one solution, so we're experimenting with a number of the formats from physical pickup points in Amazon Go to online ordering and delivery to your door through Prime Now and Amazon Fresh. And we'll see how customers respond. We like the response that we've seen so far. We think it's a valuable – all those are valuable services, Amazon Go is not out of beta, but the other ones are. On top of that, we're looking forward to adding the Whole Foods team and their great reputation for quality customer service to this offering.
