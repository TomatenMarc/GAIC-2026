Operator: Our next question comes from Ross Sandler with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.
Ross Sandler: Great. Thanks for the new disclosure guys, really helpful. I guess, just speaking, you know, now a little bit we all understand the investments you are guys are making on international, retail, and maybe with our margins been declining. Can you give us a little color on what's driving up the North America retail segment margin and I guess in the context of that, just talk about the impact that Prime is having on the retail margin for both North America and International? Thanks.
Brian Olsavsky: Yes, sure. So North America operating margin up a 120 basis points year-over-year to 3.9%. Lot of good cost efficiency, but again we're continuing to invest so actively as we build the Prime platform and that we have customers. So you'll see lot of invention definitely to see the Prime platform, which things like Video Content, Prime Music, as we talk about Prime Now devices that will continue to build fulfillment centers for selection and expansion in FBA. So that’s – its generally what's driving the operating margin in North America.
Tom Szkutak: And just to add on to that, we're – we gave metrics last quarter about Prime. It’s growing very fast. As Brian said, we're feeding the platform and certainly common thing with category expansion, new FCs, original content, Prime Instant Video devices, Prime Now. The common theme is they are all really intertwined with Prime and inextricably to our consumer business in Prime. So it’s just we're happy to do it. And the last quarter we gave an indication of the growth rates after being added for 10 year. So we're super excited to have the platform and to continue to invest in it.
Ross Sandler: Great. Thanks guys.
