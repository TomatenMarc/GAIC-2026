Operator: That comes from Mike Olson with Piper Jaffray.
Michael J. Olson: Good afternoon. I just have one question for Tim. This may be a hard question to answer in a condensed way, but how would you describe what you expect the most near-term applications will be for developers to target using ARKit? Will it be consumer iPhone and iPad applications, enterprise applications, or I guess some combination of the two? And basically, how does this come to market in the most significant way in the next few quarters as Apple becomes the largest global platform for AR as you've talked about? Thanks.
Timothy Donald Cook: Mike, that is a great question. And I could not be more excited about AR and what we're seeing with ARKit in the early going. And to answer your question about what category it starts in, just take a look at what's already on the web in terms of what people are doing and it is all over the place. From entertainment to gaming, I've seen what I would call more small business solutions. I've seen consumer solutions. I've seen enterprise solutions. I think AR is big and profound and this is one of those huge things that we'll look back at and marvel on the start of it. So I think that customers are going to see it in a variety of ways. Enterprise takes a little longer sometimes to get going. But I can already tell you there's lots of excitement in there. And I think we'll start to see some applications there as well. And it feels great to get this thing going at a level that can get all of the developers behind it, so I couldn't be more excited about it.
Michael J. Olson: Thank you.
Nancy Paxton: Thanks, Mike. Could we have the next question, please?
