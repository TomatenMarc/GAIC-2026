Operator: Thank you. Our first question is coming from John Blackledge with Cowan. Please proceed with your question.
John Blackledge: Great. Thanks for the question. So, the first quarter GAAP operating income guide essentially implies negative incremental margins kind of at the low, mid and high end of guidance. So, just wondering if you could frame in order, if possible, the investment areas that are driving the negative incremental margins and then just generally how should we think about the margin profile in 2017? Thank you.
Brian T. Olsavsky: Sure. Thank you, John. First, let me talk about revenue just to get that out there as well. We are guiding to 17% to 25% growth on an FX-neutral basis. That includes approximately – excuse me, yes, on top of that is approximately 250 basis points or $730 million of FX negative impact which brings the non-FX adjusted rate down to – excuse me, range down to 14% to 23%. I will also point out that we have the leap year comp from last year. Last year, the extra day of leap year was worth 150 basis points to us in our Q1 revenue. This year, that reverses. So we have 150-basis point headwind to growth. And that's been factored into our guidance range. But your question was on bottom line. So yes, what you are seeing, John, is the continuation of the step-up investment that we saw in the second half of last year. I talked about, in prior calls, about the fulfillment center step-up. We had 26 warehouses we added last year. 23 of them were in the second half of the year. Digital content, digital video content and marketing stepped up quite a bit in the second half of the year. We continue to invest heavily in those two areas. We also have investments in other Prime benefits from Prime Now to AmazonFresh and of course we are continuing to invest in Alexa and our Echo devices. And finally, I guess, I'd point out India which continues to be a rather large investment for us.
