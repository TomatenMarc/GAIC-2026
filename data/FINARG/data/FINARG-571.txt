Operator: Our next question is coming from the line of Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal. Please proceed with your question.
Keith Bachman: Satya, I wanted to direct this to you, if I could. I’d like to understand how you view dynamics current positioning compared to the market opportunities? And the context of the question is, dynamics remains a fairly small part of Microsoft revenues as well if you look at the market share of where dynamic serve, it's a fairly small part of the markets served. So, what do you think Microsoft needs to do to have a larger impact against the market opportunities?
Satya Nadella: Overall, we are very committed and very bullish about the opportunity in dynamics. With Dynamics 365 for example, what you even to see in this last fiscal year which has been the first full fiscal year where we have this modern, modular approach to business application. I think it's very disruptive in the market place because it brings a very different value proposition. It has a price advantage and the value advantage for customers. And in it what is fundamentally fragmented mark, this is not a business application never was and never will be a winner-take-all. I know folks think about it best state, it’s not I mean it’s about one small category in one segment called enterprise. There’s a share -- high share consider it 25%, 35% of what have you. So in some sense, this one has always been about being able to serve customers especially in an increasing digitization work, right, which is the need for more business process automation is increasing. Take an IoT project, translate into a preventive maintenance in Azure and then ends up as fields service and Dynamics, that’s been one pattern and we’ve seen a ton of traction with. So to me us going in fact to these new secular growth opportunities while being disruptive to the status quo of anyone who has high margins and very high price monolithic products today is basically our strategy going forward.
