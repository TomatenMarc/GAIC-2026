Operator: Your next question comes from Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs.
Heather Bellini: Great, thank you so much. I wanted to follow up on two comments, one watch that Sherlyn was just talking about related to checkout. I’m just wondering if you could share what the feedback has been so far from the brands that are in the closed beta and how this has helped maybe some stats if they have them like how it helped maybe conversion for the brands that are doing it versus maybe the traditional way they were selling on Instagram. So, if you have anything you could share there and then Dave, just back to Ross’ comment related to the deceleration that you’re referencing. I mean in the past, you’ve given us a little bit more specificity, not too much, but you’ve said kind of mid-single digit or low-single digit decel. Just wondering if there is any other color you could provide us here for the back half in 2020 when you’re painting this at a high level? Thank you.
Sheryl Sandberg: Yes. on the check outs beta, it’s just really small and really early. We definitely hear that it decreases at friction in the shopping experience, but with 23 brands in a product, that’s just too small for us to take any real learnings. We are working with them on iterating the product experience for now.
Dave Wehner: And Heather on the deceleration, we’re simply guiding that we would expect that we would see constant currency revenue deceleration sequentially with that being more pronounced on a constant currency basis in Q4, again, due to the tougher comp for us in Q4 not giving specific quantitative guidance on that at this point.
