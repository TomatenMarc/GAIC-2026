Operator: Your next question is from Brian Wieser with Pivotal Research. Your line is open.
Brian W. Wieser: Thanks for taking the question. You mentioned 40 million small businesses have active Pages. I'm wondering if you could update us on how many individual small businesses, or businesses in total are buying ads right now? And separately, I was curious about your current thoughts on how ad tech businesses will evolve. If you see integrated marketplace evolving, or if you see a discreet demand in supply-side businesses evolving?
Sheryl K. Sandberg: So on the first, we announced that we have over 2 million advertisers who are buying ads on Facebook. And the process for that is often that small businesses become organic users, so those 40 million small business Pages that are using it once a month and then we're able to move them onto being advertisers. And the best way we've done that is by simplified ad products. 82% of people who start advertising with us start with our really simple ad products. You know, do you want to pay a few dollars or a few pounds or a few euro to sponsor this post is a really easy on-ramp for a small business. In terms of overall ad tech world, I think a lot is happening and there's a lot that's going to evolve in the whole ecosystem. Our focus is on bringing people-based marketing and the effectiveness and relevance of Facebook ads off of Facebook so we can give marketers and publishers the tools to reach people across all of their devices. An importantly for our business, is connect the dots between online marketing and business outcomes. And you heard on this call me give a few examples of where we're already able to connect what happens in terms of ads with real sales of real products. For us, this is an important investment and it's very strategic. We are going to put the time in to make this work rather than look for any short-run specific return.
