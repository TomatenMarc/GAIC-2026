Operator: Thank you. Our next question come from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please proceed.
Raimo Lenschow: Hey thanks for taking my question and congrats from me as well. Quick question for Satya. Now that Windows 10 is on 200 million devices, what do you see on the developer network, because one of the big aims was you have a uniform platform for developers to go against the PC, tablet, et cetera. What do you see in terms of them kind of starting to embrace the platform and use the opportunity there? Thank you.
Satya Nadella: Yeah, thanks for the question and yeah, you're absolutely right. That was one of our biggest strategic objectives was to get active devices and with Store integrated into the installed base and in the user experience so that we could increase these successful developers. And we're seeing good early signs. In my opening commentary, I talked a little bit about both the increased visits to the Store and transactions as well as the fact that we are attracting new applications from developers like Netflix to Wall Street Journal to others. And as you can imagine, our share is today in desktops, in emerging in tablets, in 2-in-1 and of course now with Xbox as well, which is you know got great attraction to gaming developers. So those are the natural places where you'll see us gain more developers and gain more traction. We are big believers in a unified developer platform and a unified Store, and then as Windows 10 monthly active devices increases and the Store usage increases, we'll see more and more developers take advantage of it.
Raimo Lenschow: Perfect. Thank you.
Chris Suh: Thanks, Raimo. We'll take the next question, please.
