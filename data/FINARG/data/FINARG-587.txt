Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC Thank you. So I think, Brian, I had a question on your international shopping rollout, so I think this was recently announced. Where do you think you measure up versus some of the more local players where you might not have a direct presence in the country? And where do you think your value proposition lies? And presumably this is informed by users coming in from those regions where you don't really have an official site for people come in to buy stuff from you anyway. So, which regions or countries are accounting for most of the demand that you are seeing? Thank you.
Brian T. Olsavsky: Stephen, are you're still on? Can you elaborate more on the countries you're talking about, specifically? Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC No, I'm just wondering, you already have a direct presence in some of the countries like China, Japan, et cetera, and the international shopping rollout presumably expands all that selection to most of the globe. So just wondering if you are seeing incremental demand, and where you might be seeing demand coming in from countries where you might not have a direct presence?
Brian T. Olsavsky: Oh, on global store? Okay. Yes. Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC Yeah.
Brian T. Olsavsky: Yeah. Sorry, I thought you meant some of our expansion countries. So, yeah, I don't have a lot to share on that today, but I think you hit on the main point, is selection and opportunities for sellers in – who are with us in different countries to reach buyers outside of their home country. So it's a great benefit for sellers, and it only works if it's a great benefit for customers on the other side.
