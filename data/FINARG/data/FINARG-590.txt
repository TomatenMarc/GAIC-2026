John R Blackledge: Oh, great. Thank you. A couple of questions on video. Mark, I think you mentioned potentially some new options for video monetization.

David M. Wehner: You can go first.

That's going to be the primary driver of video growth for us. So that's really the main focus. We've got other areas that we're experimenting with like suggested videos, which are going to be very much like those ads in a feed of suggested videos, which are also an opportunity for us. But essentially, the focus is going to be on monetizing through feed ads for video.
David M. Wehner: I think you got them.
