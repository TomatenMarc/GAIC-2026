Operator: Your last question comes from Brent Thill from Jefferies.
Brent Thill: Thanks, Dave. I think a lot of us are having a hard time reconcile that the tougher comp in Q4. It was your easiest comp and you just accelerated your constant currency growth in the quarter. So I guess, just, is there any change in terms of the visibility or the contracts that you’re putting together that lead you to that, any other color. I think there is a number of questions, just trying to understand why you have such strong conviction in that decel?
Dave Wehner: Hey, Brent. So in terms of the outlook. Remember, we don’t have contracted revenue. We are constantly working from an auction perspective. So our forecasts are based on supply and demand and how we see the different product launches playing into that different optimizations that we make. So there’s a lot of granularity that goes into thinking about how revenue will progress that ultimately it’s going to depend on the supply and demand characteristics in that given quarter when we do that and we see that we expect constant currency deceleration. And when we get to Q4 we’re going to be lapping some particularly successful optimizations that we had in Q4 and that’s going to contribute to more of a decel in Q4 than we think we’ll see in Q3. So that’s the reason I’m characterizing the guidance the way I am.
Deborah Crawford: Great. Thank you for joining us today. We appreciate your time and we look forward to speaking with you again.
