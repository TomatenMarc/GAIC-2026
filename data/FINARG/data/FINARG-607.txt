Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with [Ever AB] [ph]. Please proceed with your question.
Mark Moerdler: Thank you. Congrats first on the great quarter, and Chris, thanks and congratulations on the new position, so you'll be greatly successful. Satya, I'd like to ask you a question, can you give us a sense of what is the adoption of Azure in the U.S. versus International, not just in the revenue point of view. But in terms of the mix of premium workloads, types of workloads, et cetera? How should we think, where we are in that process?
Satya Nadella: I would say, the U.S. has been a lead market in general when it comes to the latest technology and architectural paradigm adoption, whether it'd like take something like AI or the higher-level services around data. We clearly see first things happening in U.S. and quickly followed by geographies like Germany and the UK. There are certain workloads like the IoT workload, where we do see very advanced action in countries like Germany, especially with the industrial customers in terms of smart factories, Japan. But I think broadly, I don't see any difference than say, what we used to see or what we still see on our server or any other technology adoption curves. And they have differences in industry patterns, because different industries are strong in different parts of the globe. So - and then, they represent different use cases in terms of the components of Azure that get used.
Mark Moerdler: Thank you.
Chris Suh: Thanks, Mark. We'll take next question please, Ria.
