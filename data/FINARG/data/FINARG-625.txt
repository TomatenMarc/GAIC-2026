Operator: Our next question comes from Justin Post with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Justin Post: Thank you. We did see the acceleration in EGM. Just wondering if some of the local delivery and Prime Now is driving that acceleration. Is that having a big impact on your business? And down the road, do you think the delivery infrastructure will be valuable in maybe delivering third party and other units? Thank you.
Phil Hardin: This is Phil. So it's still pretty early for a lot of the really expedited delivery options. We've been working on our network for about 20 years to be able to enable some of the really fast delivery with things like Prime Now. But at this point, we're in a relatively small list of cities, but it's expanding pretty fast. I think we launched a couple more Prime Now cities just today, so that brings us up to about 17 across the globe. On the next day or same day, here in the U.S., we continue to expand that as well, but we think that those fast options add us to the consideration set of a customer's purchase on some purchases that we might not otherwise be included in. But at this point, we're still working on that and kind of getting it up to speed. So nothing specific to call out on that. On the other part of your question, we continue to work on the network around the world, but I can't respond to any of the rumors and speculation.
