Operator: Our next question comes from Ron Josey of JMP Securities. Please state your question.
Ron Victor Josey: Great. Thanks for taking the question. I want to go back to North America but this time just focus on margins. 5.5%, 5.4% margins, I think that's the highest level since maybe 2Q 2010 and resumes the margin expansion we saw really for most of last year. So just hoping we can understand – help us understand a little bit more what's driving that? I'm sure the more mature Prime flywheel you mentioned that's happening in Europe. But is there anything else that's going on besides Prime flywheel, maybe more efficient shipping or things along those lines? Thanks.
Brian T. Olsavsky: I'll start. I think you see the growth rate of the segment at 27%. It's showing the success we're having with customers. When we grow at that clip, we can do a lot of good things it. We can – on the cost side, we run our facilities more efficiently, we can buy better, we can look to in-source some things that we may have paid externally for. So, there's a number of things that we can do that I think will show up on the bottom line. But principally, what we're trying to do now is – again, make the Prime experiences as strong as possible for consumers.
Phil Hardin: This is Phil. The other thing I would add to that is that the margin you see in any quarter is really the output of our rate of investment at some places and drive for efficiencies in others. And we're not really trying to optimize for any particular number in a given quarter. We're just trying to make the best decisions we can to grow long-term free cash flow per share. And so, again, we're juggling the investment in the places where we feel like we have long-term opportunities where we need to invest with making sure we're getting continuously better in all our other processes at the same time.
