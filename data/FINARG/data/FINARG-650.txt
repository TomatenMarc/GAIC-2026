Operator: Certainly. Our first question comes from Mark May with Citi. Please proceed. Your line is live.
Mark May: Thanks for taking my questions. You clearly had a lot of things working well in the quarter, but maybe just focusing in on AWS, which seems to be quickly emerging as kid of your largest contributor to operating income. Can you maybe provide a little more color on what drove the acceleration and just the overall growth in the business? If you could talk a little bit about the addition of new customers versus average spend per customer and I think in the past you've talked about what unit growth was for AWS? And in the press release you talked about expanding AWS into some new International markets. Can you give us a feel for how much of AWS' business today is domestic and what kind of opportunity you have there to expand AWS outside the U.S.?
Brian T. Olsavsky: Yes, Mark. Thanks for your question. We will not be providing the granular customer detail unfortunately but we will say the growth of 81% was up 49% in Q1. You remember that we are lapping a number of large price decreases in Q2 of last year, so it was somewhat expected but a very strong quarter in AWS. We did announce a region in India. The other thing to mention is that we continue to see very strong usage of growth that's outpacing the revenue growth of 81% obviously. And so, we're really excited about it. From a distribution of customers, it is a global business. We have regions spread throughout the world; we have 11 regions at this point and have announced plans to launch a region in India in the future.
