Operator: Our next question comes from Justin Post with Merrill Lynch.
Justin Post: Hey, couple of questions on margins. First on AWS a think those are higher than most of us were thinking. Appreciate the disclosure. What is driving your margin versus your pricing decision? How do you think about passenger cost efficiencies or potential margin growth through your customers. And then secondly on international margins you know, clearly below history, below the US, what kind of things need to happen to get those at least to where the US is today much less back to where they were six or seven years ago? Thank you.
Tom Szkutak: Justin I'll take the AWS portion of the question first. So our model over the long-term really has been to innovate and to use our scale and position to be able to pass savings along to customers. And so we've had 48 price decreases since we launched. As I talked about earlier, that’s one factor customers save a lot of money, but the primary motivator is really around the innovation that AWS enables and the ability for developers to move really quickly.
Brian Olsavsky: And in terms of international, again as you mentioned Justin, we are investing a lot right now which impacts the margins there again ex-exchange think of it as approximately breakeven for the quarter. And so again, we're continuing to invest. We're investing in all the things that we talked about related to the platform, continue invest in some emerging geographies, most notably certainly India with the step up given the experience we have. And so we are optimistic over time. We have a lot to do there, we think it’s a great opportunity for us. And so that’s what we're doing, but we're excited about the opportunity and that’s why you see the results that you're seeing there.
