Primary energy sources for hydrogen production
The cost of hydrogen from water electrolysis is estimated, assuming that the electricity was produced from solar, hydro-, fossil, or nuclear power.
The costs for hydrogen end-use in the sectors of power generation, heat and transportation are calculated, based on a state-of-the-art technology and a more advanced technology expected to represent the state by the year 2010.
The cost of hydrogen utilization (without energy taxes) is higher than the current price of fossil fuels (including taxes).
Without restrictions imposed on fossil fuel consumption, hydrogen will not gain a significant market share in either of the cases discussed.
