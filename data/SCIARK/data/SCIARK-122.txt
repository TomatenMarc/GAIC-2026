BEING POOR IN A RICH "NANNY STATE": DEVELOPMENTS IN SINGAPORE SOCIAL WELFARE
 This paper reviews the trends in poverty and inequality in Singapore since independence, as well as policy recommendations adopted through the years, and their results.
Poverty is discussed not only in terms of wage earnings, but also in relation to employment conditions, social challenges that pile up together with income poverty, and intergenerational mobility.
The paper finds that notwithstanding improvements in early decades, after fifty years, the problems of a social divide and poverty have come full circle.
Social policy in Singapore retains its fundamentally productivist philosophical orientation, but the recent deterioration in poverty, inequality and mobility trends is leading to adoption of more welfare-oriented and universalist policy solutions.
Social inclusion is now a national priority, and policy redirection for the future needs to take place in wide-ranging policy domains, including the labor market and economic growth.
