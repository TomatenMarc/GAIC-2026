Female Genital Mutilation Reconstruction: A Preliminary Report
Abstract
Background: Female genital mutilation (FGM) is internationally recognized as a violation of human rights.
Though rarely discussed, FGM is prevalent, affecting hundreds of millions of females worldwide.
Objectives: We believe that is important for plastic surgeons to be informed and prepared to address the surgical and emotional needs of these women.
We present our experience on treatment of women subjected to FGM.
Methods: Three consecutive patients were treated by our clitoral restoration procedure.
The procedure involves conscious sedation and involves wide release of scar tissue around the labia majora and clitoris.
Labial flaps are elevated and secured down to the periosteum and the clitoris is allowed to remucosalize.
Results: Three females with grade II mutilation were treated.
The average age was 32.3-years-old and the average follow up was 305 days.
All patients self-reported improved sexual function and decreased embarrassment with their partners.
And all recommended the treatment to other women subjected to FGM.
Conclusions: FGM is a violation of the basic rights of women and children.
Plastic surgeons can help these women restore their physical and psychological sense of well-being by providing effective reconstructive options.
Our goal is to raise awareness of this problem and describe a simple yet effective treatment for women that have been subject to FGM.
