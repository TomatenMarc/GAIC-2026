Childhood road traffic injuries in Canada - a provincial comparison of transport injury rates over time
Background:                    In Canada, road traffic injuries are the leading cause of death among children and youth ≤19.
Across the country, there is variability in road traffic injury prevention policies and legislation.
Our objective was to compare pediatric road traffic related injury hospitalization and death rates across Canadian provinces.
Methods:                    Population-based hospitalization and death rates per 100,000 were analyzed using data from the Discharge Abstract Database and provincial coroner's reports.
Road traffic related injuries sustained by children and youth ≤19 years were analyzed by province and cause between 2006 and 2012.
Results:                    The overall transport-related injury morbidity rate for children in Canada was 70.91 per 100,000 population between 2006 and 2012.
The Canadian population-based injury hospitalization rates from all transport-related causes significantly decreased from 85.51 to 58.77 per 100,000 (- 4.42; p < 0.01; - 5.42; - 3.41) during the study period.
Saskatchewan had the highest overall transport related morbidity rate (135.69 per 100,000), and Ontario had the lowest (47.12 per 100,000).
Similar trends were observed for mortality rates in Canada.
Conclusions:                    Transport-related injuries among children and youth have significantly decreased in Canada from 2006 to 2012; however the rates vary by province and cause.
