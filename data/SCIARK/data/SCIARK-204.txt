Suicide in Serbia.
BACKGROUND: Suicide remains a significant public health problem worldwide.
The aim of this study was to assess the mortality trend of suicide in Serbia for the years 1991-2014.
METHODS: Data on persons who died of suicide and self-inflicted injury  (site codes E950-E959 revision 9 and X60-X84 revision 10 of the International Classification of Diseases to classify death, injury and cause of death) were obtained from the Statistical Office of the Republic of Serbia.
The age standardized rate was calculated by direct method (per 100,000 persons, using Segi's World population as standard population).
Average annual percentage change (AAPC) with the corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) was computed for trend using the joinpoint regression analysis.
RESULTS: Total 33,930 (24,016 men and 9914 women) suicide deaths occurred in Serbia during the observed period, with the average annual age-standardized mortality rate being 12.7 per 100,000 inhabitants (19.5 per 100,000 in men and 6.7 per 100,000 in women).
Suicide mortality in all age groups was higher among men than women.
In both genders, suicide rates were highest in the oldest age group.
Significantly decreased trend in suicide mortality was recorded continuously from 1991 to 2014 (AAPC=-1.9%, 95%CI -2.2 to -1.6).
The most frequently used suicide method in both genders was hanging, strangulation or suffocation with 61.2% off all suicides.
Changes in mortality rates were significant both for suicide by firearms, air guns and explosives (AAPC=-1.5% (AAPC=-1.5% in men and -3.1%-3.1% in women) and for suicide by hanging, strangulation, and suffocation (AAPC=-1.2%  (AAPC=-1.2% in men and -3.0%-3.0% in women).
In men, nonsignificant increase in suicide by firearms, air guns and explosives observed during the period 1991-1997  (by +6.1% per year) was followed by a significant decrease until 2014 (by -3.1% per year).
The significantly increased mortality in suicide by firearms, air guns, and explosives was observed in older men (aged 40-69 years and 80 years and over).
LIMITATIONS: The low rate of autopsies in Serbia, as well as the accuracy, reliability and comparability of the suicide mortality data is always a question.
CONCLUSIONS: Downward trend in suicide mortality occurred in Serbia in last two decades.
However, suicide rates are still very high in Serbia compared with the rates of suicides in developed countries.
Particularly worrisome is the increase in mortality in older men, especially due to firearm suicides, air rifles, and explosives.
Thus, additional efforts in the prevention of suicide are very important.
