Women participation: A productivity strategy in rice production
Abstract
Agriculture is an important engine for economic growth and a vigorous driver of poverty reduction in developing countries.
In Pakistan, rice production is one of the most essential sectors.
However, it has been underperforming, largely because of low women's participation, which is often a crucial resource in agriculture and the rural economy.
Unfortunately, previous studies have seldom recognized and emphasized the role of women in triggering agricultural and rural development.
We address this research gap using 300 farm households' survey data forms collected from Pakistan farmers by applying the stochastic frontier analysis.
The results indicate that women's participation is associated with higher labor/land ratio, land productivity, and finally improved technical efficiency.
Precisely, women's participation increased technical efficiency (TE) by 47.3%.
Interestingly, in view of previous studies, this evidence is not sporadic.
Overall, our study provides some evidence to promote women's participation in rice production, as such empowerment of women holds great potential to enhance agricultural production, which is consistent with the aim of sustainable development goals (SDGs).
