Decomposing the rural-urban gap in the factors of under-five mortality in sub-Saharan Africa?
Evidence from 35 countries
Background: Understanding urban-rural gap in childhood survival is essential for health care interventions and to explain disparities in the determinants of Under-5 mortality.
There is dearth of information about the factors explaining differentials in urban-rural Under-5 mortality especially in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA).
In this study, we sought to quantify the contributions of bio-demographic, socioeconomic and proximate factors in explaining the urban-rural gap in Under-5 mortality in SSA.
Methods: This study utilized secondary data from Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) in 35 sub-Saharan countries conducted between 2006 and 2016.
Child (aged 0 and 59 months) death was the outcome variable in this study.
Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition was used to decipher urban-rural gap in the factors of Under-5 mortality.
Results: Significant urban-rural differentials were observed in Under-5 mortality across bio-demographic, socioeconomic and proximate factors.
In the decomposition model, about 44.27% of urban group and 74.71% of rural group had Under-5 mortality in sub-Saharan countries.
Maternal age, education, use of newspaper, TV, wealth index, total children ever born, size of baby and age at first birth contributed towards explaining urban-rural gap inUnder-5 mortality.
Conclusion: These findings could be contributory to health care system improvement and socioeconomic developmental plans to address under-5 mortality in SSA.
Strengthening maternal and child health (MCH) programmes, specifically in rural areas and improving health care services would help to ensure overall child survival.
