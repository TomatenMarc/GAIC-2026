This paper, based on the Kuznets curve associated toenvironmental analysis, aims to analyze the relationship between gender equalityand sustainable development.
The cross-sectional analysis, with data from 11countries in Central Africa in 2010, was used.

When the Multidimensionalpoverty index increases, environmental problems reduce, translating the role ofgender in sustainable development in all Central Africa countries.
