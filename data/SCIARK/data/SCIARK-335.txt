Late complications of childhood female genital mutilation.
BACKGROUND
Canada's immigrants are increasingly from non-English-speaking countries with different medical issues.
Female genital mutilation (FGM) is a procedure performed for non-medical reasons that is not traditionally encountered in Canada and that has serious health implications for women.
CASE
A 36-year-old woman, who underwent FGM at the age of four, presented to our colposcopy unit with increasing swelling of the vulva.
Examination revealed a large cystic mass in the midline of the vulva, and MRI identified two well-defined cystic lesions.
The mass was excised, and histologic examination confirmed an epidermal inclusion cyst.
CONCLUSION
An epidermal inclusion cyst can develop as a long-term consequence of FGM.
Although it grows slowly and usually without symptoms, it may require excision because of inflammation, secondary infection, or, in rare cases, malignancy developing within the cyst.
