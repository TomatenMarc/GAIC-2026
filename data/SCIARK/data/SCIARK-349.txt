Global and regional estimates of violence against women
The report presents a global systematic review of scientific data on the prevalence of two forms of violence against women: violence by an intimate partner (intimate partner violence) and sexual violence by someone other than a partner (non-partner sexual violence).
It shows global and regional estimates of the prevalence of these two forms of violence, using data from around the world.
The report details the effects of partner and non-partner sexual violence on several aspects of women’s health.
It shows that women who have experienced intimate partner violence have higher rates of depression, HIV, injury and death, and are more likely to have low birth weight babies, than those who haven’t.
Though research on the health effects of non-partner sexual violence is more limited, the evidence clearly shows that sexual violence has both long- and short-term debilitating effects on women’s mental health and well-being.
