The Effects of Economic and Financial Development on Financial Inclusion in Africa
This study provides empirical evidence on the effects of economic and financial development on financial inclusion in Africa, using panel FMOLS for the 2005-2014 period.
The study shows that economic growth has a significant positive impact on financial inclusion, meaning that African countries with higher economic growth have more inclusive financial systems.
GDP per capita has a significant positive impact on financial inclusion.
That is, income is an important factor in explaining the level of ﬁnancial inclusion in Africa.
It is, as well, established in this study, that although both economic and financial development promote financial inclusion, though the effects of economic development are much stronger.
Also, inflation is negatively linked to financial inclusion, and as well insignificant across all specifications.
Deposit interest rate is positively linked to financial inclusion, though insignificant.
The low deposit interest rates in African countries do not encourage inclusive financial systems.
Population, though positive, is insignificant.
Internet has positive significant impact on financial inclusion, meaning that internet access is indispensable in a fast-moving and digital African economy.
Literacy is also statistically significant, meaning that adult literacy is an important factor in explaining the level of ﬁnancial inclusion in Africa.
As well, Islamic banking presence and activity are associated with higher financial inclusion.
