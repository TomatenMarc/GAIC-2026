Title:Climate-driven polar motion: 2003-2015
Abstract: Earth's spin axis has been wandering along the Greenwich meridian since about 2000, representing a 75° eastward shift from its long-term drift direction.
The past 115 years have seen unequivocal evidence for a quasi-decadal periodicity, and these motions persist throughout the recent record of pole position, in spite of the new drift direction.
We analyze space geodetic and satellite gravimetric data for the period 2003-2015 to show that all of the main features of polar motion are explained by global-scale continent-ocean mass transport.
The changes in terrestrial water storage (TWS) and global cryosphere together explain nearly the entire amplitude (83 ± 23%) and mean directional shift (within 5.9° ± 7.6°) of the observed motion.
We also find that the TWS variability fully explains the decadal-like changes in polar motion observed during the study period, thus offering a clue to resolving the longstanding quest for determining the origins of decadal oscillations.
This newly discovered link between polar motion and global-scale TWS variability has broad implications for the study of past and future climate.
