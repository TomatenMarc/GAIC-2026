Experiences of Racism and Racial Tensions Among African American Women Impacted by Commercial Sexual Exploitation in Practice: A Qualitative Study
Barriers faced by Black women when navigating commercial sexual exploitation (CSE)-related services remain understudied.
This qualitative study explores (a) Black women’s experiences of racism when accessing services in CSE-related organizations and (b) the existence and manifestation of racial tensions in practice.
In-depth interviews were conducted with 30 adult women who traded sex as adults and 20 CSE-related service providers.
Findings suggest that Black women perceive preferential treatment given to White women.
Racial tensions between women accessing programs were identified, as well as a promising practice of intergroup dialogue groups addressing racism, privilege, and oppression.
Implications are discussed.
