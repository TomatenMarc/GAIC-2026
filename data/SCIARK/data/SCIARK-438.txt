Prevalence and attitudes on female genital mutilation/cutting in Egypt since criminalisation in 2008
Female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C), which can result in severe pain, haemorrhage and poor birth outcomes, remains a major public health issue.
The extent to which prevalence of and attitudes toward the practice have changed in Egypt since its criminalisation in 2008 is unknown.
We analysed data from the 2005, 2008 and 2014 Egypt Demographic and Health Surveys to assess trends related to FGM/C.
Specifically, we determined whether FGM/C prevalence among ever-married, 15-19-year-old women had changed from 2005 to 2014.
We also assessed whether support for FGM/C continuation among ever-married reproductive-age (15-49 years) women had changed over this time period.
The prevalence of FGM/C among adolescent women statistically significantly decreased from 94% in 2008 to 88% in 2014 (standard error [SE] = 1.5), after adjusting for education, residence and religion.
Prevalence of support for the continuation of FGM/C also statistically significantly decreased from 62% in 2008 to 58% in 2014 (SE = 0.6).
The prevalence of FGM/C among ever-married women aged 15-19 years in Egypt has decreased since its criminalisation in 2008, but continues to affect the majority of this subgroup.
Likewise, support of FGM/C continuation has also decreased, but continues to be held by a majority of ever-married women of reproductive age.
