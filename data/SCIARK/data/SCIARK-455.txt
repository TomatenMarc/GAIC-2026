Empirical determinants of eco-innovation in European countries using the community innovation survey
Abstract: The determinants of eco-innovation activities have been widely explored for single countries.
However, there is a lack of analyses comparing different countries.
The Community Innovation Survey (CIS 2008) allows for an analysis of the determinants of eco-innovation in 19 different European countries.
This paper focuses on Eastern Europe as the determinants of eco-innovation have not yet been systematically analyzed for these countries.
Concerning the introduction of eco-innovations, this analysis shows that regulation activities and environmentally related subsidies seem to be more important for the Eastern countries than they are for the “richer” Western European countries.
Furthermore, the Eastern European countries rely more on competitors and external R&D as information sources, indicating a technology transfer from West to East.
