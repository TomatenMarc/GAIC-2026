Effect of female genital mutilation/cutting on sexual functions.
ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND
Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting (FGM/C) or female circumcision is the procedure of eliminating some or all parts of the external female genitalia.
FGM/C is carried out by traditional circumcisers.
They usually use cutting tools like a blade or straight-razor.
Although FGM/C is well described in the African continent and some Arabic countries, data from Iran are scarce.
OBJECTIVES
The major objective of this current study was to investigate the effects of FGM/C on the female sexual function of married women compared to the non-circumcised women in the Kurdistan province of Iran.
METHODS
A case-control study was conducted in a sample of 280 married women (140 circumcised-women and 140 non-circumcised-women) who referred to the healthcare centers for vaccination, midwifery, or family planning services.
Participants were requested to complete the Persian-translated version of the Female Sexual Function Index.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
The total score of the FSFI and its individual domains.
RESULTS
Of the circumcised women, 51.4% reported circumcision procedures before the age of 3 years.
Religion motivation (53.6%) was mentioned as the most important factor for the family leading to FGM/C.
Almost all operations were performed by traditional circumcisers.
Non-circumcised women had significantly higher Persian-FSFI total score (25.3?
?4.34) compared to the circumcised women (17.9?
?5.39).
CONCLUSION
Sexual function in women with FGM/C is adversely altered.
In Kurdistan province women, FGM/C is associated with reduction of scores of Persian-FSFI on all domain scores.
Education in general and informing the people that FGM/C is not a religious Hadith certainly would have a great impact on the suffering of the women from FGM/C as well as the level of "desire, arousal, lubrication, orgasm, satisfaction, and pain in the sexual function of women".
