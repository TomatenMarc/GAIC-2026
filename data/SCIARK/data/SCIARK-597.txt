Conjugal violence: a comparison of violence against men by women and women by men.
Abstract
Because few studies demonstrated the types of violence performed by women, the aim of our study was to access violence men against women as well as women against men.
A retrospective study was performed based on all the medical certificates for victims who consulted our centre specialized in assault victims.
Eleven percent of the victims were men (81 men, 626 women).
Episodes of violence were most often repeated against women than men (p < 0.05).
Injuring, in most cases mild, were more frequently found in men than women (p < 0.01).
They were primarily cutaneous in 66% of cases (85% men, 64% women) and severe in 5% of cases i.e.
fractures, with no difference in gender.
Three cases of sexual assault and one case of chemical submission was observed in women.
Insults were made more often by men than by women (p < 0.002).
A psychological impact was more frequently found in women than in men (p < 0.01).
The duration of the total incapacity (incapacité totale de travail = ITT) was less than 0-3 days in most cases, and this occurred more often in 91% men than in 65% women (p < 0.01).
Consultations for domestic violence occur less frequently in men than in women.
Men present more often with injuries that are less severe compared to those observed in women.
In contrast, the psychological impact is less frequent in men.
Also episodes of violence were most often repeated when the aggressor was a man.
