Coping and chronic psychosocial consequences of female genital mutilation in the Netherlands
Objective.
The study presented in this article explored psychosocial and relational problems of African immigrant women in the Netherlands who underwent female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C), the causes they attribute to these problems – in particular, their opinions about the relationship between these problems and their circumcision – and the way they cope with these health complaints.
Design.
This mixed-methods study used standardised questionnaires as well as in-depth interviews among a purposive sample of 66 women who had migrated from Somalia, Sudan, Eritrea, Ethiopia or Sierra Leone to the Netherlands.
Data were collected by ethnically similar female interviewers; interviews were coded and analysed by two independent researchers.
Results.
One in six respondents suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and one-third reported symptoms related to depression or anxiety.
The negative feelings caused by FGM/C became more prominent during childbirth or when suffering from physical problems.
Migration to the Netherlands led to a shift in how women perceive FGM, making them more aware of the negative consequences of FGM.
Many women felt ashamed to be examined by a physician and avoided visiting doctors who did not conceal their astonishment about the FGM.
Conclusion.
FGM/C had a lifelong impact on the majority of the women participating in the study, causing chronic mental and psychosocial problems.
Migration made women who underwent FGM/C more aware of their condition.
Three types of women could be distinguished according to their coping style: the adaptives, the disempowered and the traumatised.
Health care providers should become more aware of their problems and more sensitive in addressing them.
