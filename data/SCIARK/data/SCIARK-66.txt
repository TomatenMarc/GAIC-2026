Female genital mutilation: current awareness, believes and future intention in rural Egypt
Background: Female genital cutting, also termed female genital mutilation (FGM), is a damaging practice with no health benefits for girls or women, and is considered to be a violation of children's rights.
Methods: A cross-sectional, community-based study using interview administered questionnaire to explore knowledge and attitude of people living in a rural area in Minia.
Systematic random sampling was used to interview 618 males and females above the age of 18 in the period from September to November 2016.
Results: FGM was performed on 76.6% of females, complications occurred in 35.6% of them.
Females demonstrated a higher level of knowledge than males.
Nearly 56% of respondents believed that this practice should continue.
Females were more supportive of the continuation of FGM than men (60.3% vs. 47.9%).
The attitude that FGM is a good practice, knowledge level, women's status and religion were significantly associated with women's willingness to subject their daughters to FGM in the future.
Attitude was the only significant predictor associated with men's willingness to subject their daughters to FGM.
Conclusion: The strong correlation between social pressure and intentions to carry out FGM means that FGM practice will continue to be embraced among future generations unless policies are put in place to eradicate this practice through empowering females by education and reasonable income.
