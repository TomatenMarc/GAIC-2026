'I just couldn't fit it in': Gender and unequal outcomes in academic careers
Abstract
This article reports on the findings of two pieces of research that were designed to test and challenge widely accepted theories about the causes of gender inequity in academic employment at the national level, and subsequently in a more detailed case study of one of Australia's largest and most prestigious universities.
Both research projects used large-scale surveys to capture information about levels of human capital, family responsibilities, career preferences, workloads and objective experiences of appointment and promotion.
The case study, conducted in 2002, also utilized focus group discussions with particular groups of women who seemed, from the survey data, to be located just under the glass ceiling.
The case study research confirmed the earlier national survey research which concluded that discrimination or bias in appointments, promotions and workloads were not significant in explaining men's domination of the senior levels.
It also confirmed the significant gender differences in some kinds of human capital (particularly possession of a Ph.D.).
But it also pointed to a quite particular explanation for the failure of women to progress to Level D (associate professor/reader) which involved other more general demographic changes - particularly, high rates of separation and divorce, far higher rates of partnering among men than women and the impact of older children's needs.
