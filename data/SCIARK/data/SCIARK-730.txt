Everyday (in)equality at home: Complex constructions of gender in South African families
Abstract
Background: High rates of violence and HIV have been documented within the South African context.
Constructions of masculinity and femininity that position men as dominant and highly sexually active and women as subordinate and acquiescent have been found to contribute towards gender inequality.
This inequality is in turn related to negative health consequences, specifically violence against women, children, and other men, as well as sexual risk.
Within this context it becomes important to explore how problematic constructions of gender are being (re)produced and how these constructions are being challenged.
Families have been identified as key sites in which gender is both constructed and enacted on a daily basis and it is within this space that children are first exposed to notions of gender.
Objective: This article draws from a study that was intended to expand on the limited understandings of the ways in which gender (in)equality is constructed and conveyed within the context of South African families on an everyday basis.
Design: Children and parents in 18 families from a range of different material and cultural backgrounds were interviewed about the meanings and practices of gender within their homes.
Data were analysed using a Foucauldian discourse analysis.
Results: The data reveal how problematic constructions of masculinity and femininity are (re)produced but also challenged within a range of different families.
Gender and gender (in)equality are therefore routinely accomplished in complex ways.
Conclusions: These findings have important implications for promoting gender equality and therefore for disrupting violence and sexual risk as gendered health issues.
