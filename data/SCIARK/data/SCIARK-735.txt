Energy access and transition to cleaner cooking fuels and technologies in Sri Lanka: Issues and policy limitations
Easy energy access is a trigger for human, social, and economic development.
A research project was undertaken in Sri Lanka to broaden the understanding of human dimension of energy access and technologies.
A questionnaire survey, covering 2269 households, gathered data on socio-economic contexts and issues influencing a transition towards clean cooking facilities.
The findings reveal that the transition is impeded by four factors: the lack of motivation and the pressure for switching over to cleaner facilities, the lack of modern energy technology options, the financial risks, and the lack of financing and other support.
The paper describes the delicate two-way interrelation between women earning wages and the transitions to cleaner cooking fuels and technologies.
The findings suggest the need for a policy framework involving the stakeholders, financing and standardised technologies.
To make a change it is proposed to introduce a national, integrated policy incorporating financing and energy governance.
