Pattern of injury mortality by age-group in children aged 0-14 years in Scotland, 2002-2006, and its implications for prevention
Background:                    Knowledge of the epidemiology of injuries in children is essential for the planning, implementation and evaluation of preventive measures but recent epidemiological information on injuries in children both in general and by age-group in Scotland is scarce.
This study examines the recent pattern of childhood mortality from injury by age-group in Scotland and considers its implications for prevention.
Methods:                    Routine mortality data for the period 2002-2006 were obtained from the General Register Office for Scotland and were analysed in terms of number of deaths, mean annual mortality rates per 100,000 population, leading causes of death, and causes of injury death.
Mid-year population estimates were used as the denominator.
Chi-square tests were used to determine statistical significance.
Results:                    186 children aged 0-14 died from an injury in Scotland during 2002-06 (MR 4.3 per 100,000).
Injuries were the leading cause of death in 1-14, 5-9 and 10-14 year-olds (causing 25%, 29% and 32% of all deaths respectively).
The leading individual causes of injury death (0-14 years) were pedestrian and non-pedestrian road-traffic injuries and assault/homicide but there was variation by age-group.
Assault/homicide, fire and suffocation caused most injury deaths in young children; road-traffic injuries in older ones.
Collectively, intentional injuries were a bigger threat to the lives of under-15s than any single cause of unintentional injury.
The mortality rate from assault/homicide was highest in infants (<1 year) and decreased with increasing age.
Children aged 5-9 were significantly less likely to die from an injury than 0-4 or 10-14 year-olds (p < 0.05).
Suicide was an important cause of injury mortality in 10-14 year-olds.
Conclusion:                    Injuries continue to be a leading cause of death in childhood in Scotland.
Variation in causes of injury death by age-group is important when targeting preventive efforts.
In particular, the threats of assault/homicide in infants, fire in 1-4 year-olds, pedestrian injury in 5-14 year-olds, and suicide in 10-14 year-olds need urgent consideration for preventive action.
