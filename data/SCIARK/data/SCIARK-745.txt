Gender Differences in Leadership Positions Among Academic Nuclear Medicine Specialists in Canada and the United States
Abstract
Objective: Despite equal representation of genders among medical students, women continue to be underrepresented in the field of academic diagnostic radiology.
These differences are manifest across subspecialties in academic medicine and even in diagnostic radiology.
There are limited data available addressing diversity among nuclear medicine specialists.
Thus, our primary objective was to compare gender representation in academic and leadership positions among faculty members in nuclear medicine in Canada and the United States.
Our secondary objective was to study the influences to account for the existing disparity in academic nuclear medicine.
Materials and methods: Using the Fellowship and Residency Electronic Interactive Database (FREIDA) and Canadian Resident Matching Service (CaRMS), we created a database of faculty members in nuclear medicine.
For assessment of academic performance, the h-index, number of publications, number of citations, and years of active research were extracted using Scopus.
Results: The academic ranks of 237 faculty members were used for analysis; of this group, 16.95% of associate professors were female.
Women were less frequently represented in higher academic ranks, and women were also less frequently represented in leadership ranks (13.6% female vs 86.4% male).
The h-index was comparable across genders.
Conclusion: Female nuclear medicine specialists are underrepresented in academic and leadership positions compared with their male counterparts.
This difference in numbers is unlikely to be because of academic performance given that both genders had comparable academic performance metrics in our study.
The results show the need for devising strategies to promote diversity in academic and leadership positions across nuclear medicine specialists.
