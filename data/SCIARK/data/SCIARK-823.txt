Sexual Coercion by Women: The Influence of Pornography and Narcissistic and Histrionic Personality Disorder Traits
Largely overlooked in the literature, this study investigated factors influencing women’s use of sexual coercion.
Specifically, pornography use and personality disorder traits linked with poor impulse control, emotional regulation, and superior sense of sexual desirability were considered.
Women (N = 142) aged 16–53 years (M = 24.23, SD = 7.06) were recruited from community and student populations.
Participants completed the Narcissistic and Histrionic subscales of the Personality Diagnostic Questionnaire-4, in addition to the Cyber-Pornography Use Inventory to explore the influence of their pornography use (interest, efforts to engage with pornography, and compulsivity) on their use of sexual coercion.
This was measured using four subscales of the Postrefusal Sexual Persistence Scale: nonverbal sexual arousal, emotional manipulation and deception, exploitation of the intoxicated, and use of physical force or threats.
Multiple regression analyses revealed that pornography use, narcissistic traits, and histrionic traits significantly predicted the use of nonverbal sexual arousal, emotional manipulation and deception, and exploitation of the intoxicated.
Effort to engage with pornography was a significant individual predictor of nonverbal sexual arousal and emotional manipulation and deception, while histrionic traits were a significant individual predictor of exploitation of the intoxicated.
Findings were discussed in relation to existing sexual coercion literature and potential future research.
