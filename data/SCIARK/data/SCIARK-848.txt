Sexual relationship power and malnutrition among HIV-positive women in rural uganda
Abstract
Inequality within partner relationships is associated with HIV acquisition and gender violence, but little is known about more pervasive effects on women's health.
We performed a cross-sectional analysis of associations between sexual relationship power and nutritional status among women in Uganda.
Participants completed questionnaires and anthropometric measurements.
We assessed sexual relationship power using the Sexual Relationship Power Scale (SRPS).
We performed logistic regression to test for associations between sexual relationship power and poor nutritional status including body mass index, body fat percentage, and mid-upper arm circumference.
Women with higher sexual relationship power scores had decreased odds of low body mass index (OR 0.29, p = 0.01), low body fat percentage (OR 0.54, p = 0.04), and low mid-upper arm circumference (OR 0.22, p = 0.01).
These relationships persisted in multivariable models adjusted for potential confounders.
Targeted interventions to improve intimate partner relationship equality should be explored to improve health status among women living with HIV in rural Africa.
