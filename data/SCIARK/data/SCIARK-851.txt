Gender moderates the health-effects of job strain in managers
Abstract
Purpose: To investigate cross-sectional associations between main, interactive and gender-dependent effects of the demand-control-support (DCS) model and subjective health in managers.
Methods: Data of 424 German, Austrian and Swiss managers were collected at leadership seminars and through presentation of the study at meetings of staff managers and senior executives.
Hierarchical regression models controlling for age, hierarchy and non-linear relationships were computed to assess associations between main, interactive and gender-dependent effects of the DCS dimensions (measures of job demands, job control, social support) and subjective health (measures of self rated health and psychosomatic complaints).
Results: Social support was associated with both indicators of subjective health.
Inconsistent results were obtained for the main effects of job demands and job control.
Concerning the interaction effects of the model, a significant three-way interaction was observed: high job control and high social support seem to buffer the adverse health effects of high job demands.
This interaction was moderated by gender.
Female managers experience more psychosomatic complaints working in high demand, low control, low support settings than their male colleagues.
While women seem to experience a higher buffering effect from social support than from job control, male managers may benefit equally from social support and job control.
Conclusions: In managers, gender moderates the health-related effects of the psychosocial work environment.
The gender-dependent effects of the DCS model may play a crucial role in the understanding of female managers' adverse health perceptions.
Increasing social support for female managers may help to overcome gender inequalities in management positions.
