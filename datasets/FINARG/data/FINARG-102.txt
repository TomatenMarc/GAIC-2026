Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citi. Please proceed with your question.
Walter H. Pritchard: Hi, thanks. Amy, I'm wondering, you saw very strong unearned revenue in the quarter, but I note that you saw contracted backlog that grew sequentially below what a typical June quarter does and commercial bookings that were up about 4% off of a fairly easy comp. And I'm wondering if you could just help us understand the dynamics in new and renewal signings that drove that combination of really strong unearned but somewhat weaker trends in the bookings.
Amy E. Hood: Sure. Strong unearned in particular was actually better than expected Azure billings in the quarter that drove unearned above the high end of our guide, and I think we were quite pleased by that performance. In terms of CNB, that's the reference I made in my comments to the lower expiry base. Quarter to quarter and year to year, we just have different amounts of contracts expiring. And so this was one of our lower contract bases and was lower than a year ago. So the fact that we were able to grow in that low expiry base is actually very good structural performance.
Chris Suh: Thank you, Walter. We'll take the next question, please.
