Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Aram Rubinson with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.
Aram Rubinson: Hey. Thanks very much. Two questions both on the logistics side. It seems pretty clear that you guys are trafficking in some old world assets, like truck trailers and ship lanes and air fields. Can you help give us a sense as to maybe what we're trying to accomplish with that, if it's defensive to protect your service to your existing customers or if you're looking to maybe start new businesses with those assets?
Brian Olsavsky: Sure, Aram. Thanks for your question. I would say what we've found is in order to serve – properly serve our customers at peak. We've needed to add more of our own logistics to supplement our existing partners. That's not meant to replace them. And those carriers are just not - no longer able to handle all of our capacity that we need at peak. They have been and continue to be great partners. And we look forward to working with them in the future. It's just we've had to add some resources on our own. You mentioned trucks. The Amazon trucks, we did invest in those - this past year. We use those primarily for movement between our warehouses and our source centers.
