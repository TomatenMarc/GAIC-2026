Operator: Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citi. Please proceed.
Walter Pritchard: Amy, wondering on the Office side, product and services on the commercial side, you had I think 8% growth. The lowest you’ve seen, I know 606 drive some volatility in that business. Could you help us understand, what drove that in the quarter? And I know you’re making some changes like this support and so forth as you get into the out years. Is there any impact that you expect to the gross rate in that businesses as we look forward from those changes?
Amy Hood: The entire impact in that KPI, I actually feel very good about that number because if you think about the $1 billion plus beat we had for the unearned, it was due to the fact that we had very good mix shift Office 365 in terms of billings in the quarter, almost very little of that gets recognized in quarter. Now, this all goes to the balance sheet. So, my confidence for FY19 in that number being the double digits we talked about in the full year guide, only gets raised by seeing that execution. So, it is really 606 related, if the way to think about it plus a mix of billings and billing strength. So, I don’t really think of that as being negative, and you saw the exact same behavior and dynamics. So, it's a pretty similar in period in quarter impact.
