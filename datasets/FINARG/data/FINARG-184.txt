Operator: Certainly, today that will come from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.
Katy Huberty: Thank you. Good afternoon and congratulations on the quarter. iPhone revenue trajectory did improve, but it's still declined 9%. So can you talk about the drivers that will allow you to get that category back to growth? And if you think that's something that's realistic to expect in fiscal '20?
Tim Cook: Katy, it's Tim. We are very thrilled with what we're seeing in early going on iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro and Pro Max. It's early but the trends look very good. So I don't want to make a long-range forecast here. We've put our current thinking in the guidance and you can tell from the guidance we are bullish.
Katy Huberty: Great. And Luca on margins guidance is consistent with September, but there is a lot going on under the covers; tariffs could expand in mid-December; there is some impact from the TV+ bundle; you have some big currency in commodity price move. So can you just talk about the gives and takes that land you at the December quarter gross margin guidance?
Luca Maestri: Yes. Katy, of course. As you said, I mean at the midpoint of the range, we are essentially flat sequentially. On one side, we expect -- on the positive side, we expect leverage from higher revenue. On the other side, foreign exchange for us continues to be probably the biggest headwind that we've got right now is going to be negative 70 basis points on a sequential basis.Also keep in mind that during the holiday season, we have a higher mix of products revenue than we have in other quarters, and that obviously is dilutive to the company -- to the company margin.On a year-over-year basis, we are also about flat. And on one side, we've got better commodity pricing, the environment is better than it was a year ago, but foreign exchange is a negative impact of 120 basis points on a year-over-year basis.
Nancy Paxton: Thank you, Katy. Can we have the next question please?
