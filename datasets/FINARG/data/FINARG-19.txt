Operator: Our next question comes from Ron Josey with JMP Securities.
Ron Victor Josey: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Just real quickly on paid unit growth, accelerated 26% this year. I realize it's easier comps, but anything significantly higher or anything that happened this quarter? I know Prime Day could be it, but wondering if that was the reason. And then on AWS usage, just wondering if you can give an update on usage. I believe last quarter you mentioned usage was growing faster than revenue. I wonder if that's the same case this quarter. Thank you.
Phil Hardin: So this is Phil. On the unit side, you did see units move at a rate that's highly correlated with revenue there. Keep in mind, AWS and some of the other rental-type offerings don't generate units, so we don't count those. But we did see, certainly saw some additional units as a result of Prime Day. And on a longer-term bigger basis, the continued growth of Prime, the continued selection expansion, is helping with the unit's growth there. Sorry, was there a second part of your question?
Ron Victor Josey: It was just on AWS unit growth. I think last quarter, you said it was growing faster than revenue. I'm wondering if that's still the case here.
Phil Hardin: We continue to see really, yeah, sorry. We continue to see really strong usage growth across the board, and it's coming from customers of all sizes. We also have recently announced that Aurora, which is our new database software, is our fastest-growing service ever. So for a long time, we talked about Redshift, and Aurora has now outpaced that. So we're very excited about what we're seeing there.
