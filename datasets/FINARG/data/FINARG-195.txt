Operator: Our last question comes from Brad Reback with Stifel. Please proceed.
Brad Reback: Amy quick question with the recent release of WinServer 16, is there any reason to think that we shouldn't see some uptick in the transactional business, especially with easing comps in the next couple of quarters? Thanks.
Amy Hood: With our annuity mix as high as it is, it can impact at a couple points either way, but I don't think about that as really immaterial impact. You should think about in the next couple of quarters. And our focus will always be making sure we have a clear roadmap for customers to make long-term commitments through annuity and so we are really trying to get away from some of that launch impact that you may normally expect to see.
Chris Suh: So that wraps up the Q&A portion of today's earnings call. We look forward to seeing many of you in the coming months at various investor conferences. For those unable to attend in person these event will be webcast and you can follow our comments at Microsoft investor relations website.
