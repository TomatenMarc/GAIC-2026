Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.
Mark Mahaney: Okay. I was going to also then ask you to drill down a little bit on the international retail business. That seemed to slow down, I guess that whatever, 15% or something year-over-year. Any particularly color? Any markets that would have led to that? Though the comp was tougher, but anything else you'd call out there? Thanks a lot.
Brian T. Olsavsky: Sure. On a year-over-year basis, I think you have to look at two things. We did the Souq acquisition last year in May. So the full pickup on that year-over-year was in 2017 and now we're lapping that. There's also material change in the Diwali calendar in India. About half of our Diwali sales last year were in Q3. This year they'll be fully in Q4. So those are a couple factors that hit the international growth area in particularly. But I also point out that we launched Turkey in the quarter and now we have 17 Amazon websites globally. So we're still very pleased again with the international business, continue to invest in Prime benefits, international expansion as I just mentioned, and we're still seeing very good pickup. Story is different country-by-country obviously. Some are much further along than others, but overall we're very happy. India, although Diwali moved into Q4, so far that's going really well. We've seen great response from customers. We've had 60% growth in new customers during the period. Orders are coming in from 99% of the pin codes in the country. So, great first wave of the, what we call the Amazon's Great Indian Festival, which lead into Diwali.
