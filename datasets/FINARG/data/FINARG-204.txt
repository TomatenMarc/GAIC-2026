Operator: And next from Piper Jaffray, we'll hear from Gene Munster.
Gene Munster: Good afternoon. Tim, could you talk a little bit about the iPhone upgrade program and the theme of iPhone as a subscription? In particular, do you believe that this could have a measurable impact on the December quarter once we anniversary this? And then any thoughts on rolled outside the U.S. when that program would. And I guess my follow-up question would be I know you can't talk about new products, but any high level thoughts on the virtual reality theme. Do you think this is more of a geeky niche or something that could go mainstream?
Tim Cook: On your first question about iPhone, I think the most important thing, Gene, as you know for us, will always be the product and the experience. And so that's first and foremost. Secondly, I would say we were blown away by the level of Android switchers that we had last quarter. It was the highest ever by far. And so we see that as a huge opportunity. Thirdly, the markets, sort of the emerging markets broader than BRIC, but including all of emerging, when I look at our share in these markets and the LTE penetration, I see huge opportunities. In terms of the upgrade program itself, I think over time, it will be meaningful as customers get into a different pattern. How much of that plays out in the Q1 of 2017 range is difficult to say. My own sense would be that the other items I've mentioned are probably more important but I am optimistic about the upgrade program as well.
Gene Munster: And then virtual reality?
Tim Cook: Yeah. In terms of virtual reality, no, I don't think it's a niche. I think it can be -- it's really cool and has some interesting applications.
Nancy Paxton: Thank you, Gene.
Gene Munster: Thank you.
Nancy Paxton: Could we have the next question please?
