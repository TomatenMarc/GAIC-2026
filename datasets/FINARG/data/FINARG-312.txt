Operator:  Your first question comes from the line of Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley.
Brian Nowak: Thanks for taking my question. I have two, the first one on the core Facebook app. I was wondering if you could tell us a little bit more about the impact on engagement as well as monetization from the redesign. Dave, I think you mentioned some optimization and product win. So, what are you seeing on the core app, I guess, now a big weight on engagement and monetization. And then can you talk to us a little bit more about some of the ad targeting headwinds that you foresee in 4Q and in 2020? Thanks.
Dave Wehner: Sure, Brian, it’s Dave. I think on the Facebook app, I just say the DAU trend paints the picture broadly for Facebook. We’re seeing stability in the developed markets and growth in the developing markets. And so, we’re continuing to see solid performance on Facebook, and we’re pleased with the engagement levels that we’re seeing overall on the Facebook app. So, I think the first half has been solid from that perspective. And then the second question was on the ad targeting related headwinds. So, we think of those in really three components. The first is regulatory as you think about things like GDPR and other impacts and how those will be rolling out globally. The second is platform changes as it relates to operating systems and a more of a focus on privacy from the operating systems and the impact that that can have on measurements and also on targeting. And then the third is our own product changes as we put privacy more front and center. So really, it’s the compounding of those three issues that are creating headwinds that we think are going to impact us, as we get later in the year and into 2020.
