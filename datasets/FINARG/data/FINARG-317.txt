Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Justin Post from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Justin Post: A couple of questions, first on the privacy commentary. Dave, has anything changed since third quarter when we're looking at less deceleration this year? Has there been incremental changes since then? And then secondly, on the expense outlook, I noticed headcount growth was around 26%. As far as getting to your headcount guide -- I mean to your expense guide, do you expect that growth to accelerate? And are there other kind of expense initiatives you'd call out for 2020? 
David Wehner: Yes. Thanks, Justin. So I don't think anything has changed since Q3 in terms of our outlook on the headwinds that we have around ad signals. I think that's very consistent with what we've been talking about over the last several quarters. So I think we'll -- we continue to face those headwinds, and they will be more impactful as we move forward.  In terms of the expense guide in 2020, I would say that obviously we plan to -- a large factor of our expense growth is driven off of headcount. And we're continuing to invest across the board in terms of our core R&D and innovation efforts in terms of headcount growth there.  In addition, growth in infrastructure spend is our large increase in CapEx over the last several years, flows through the income statement as another driver of our expense growth as well. And there's other nonheadcount-related expenses that we expect to grow, including marketing and content investments.
