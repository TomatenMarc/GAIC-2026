Operator: Our next question comes from Colin Sebastian with Robert Baird.
Colin Sebastian: Great. Thanks. Maybe just another follow up on the new segment disclosures. Thanks for breaking it out. You know if we assume that the advertising segment is reasonably profitable than the implication is then that the core retail business is very modestly profitable close to breakeven. And just wondering what the thought process and strategy is behind that. If in a sense there is some subsidy to the retail side being used as you build market share in the core business? Thanks.
Tom Szkutak: Yes, I think the best way to think about it is, we certainly have an advertising part of our North American consume segments. But the way you should think about it is, we are making some great investments for the long-term and that’s really what's reflected in the operating results that you are seeing in terms of – so it is certainly impacting the operating margins both for North American and International. So it’s the things that we – both Brian and I talked about that we're doing globally to support Prime platform all of those things that we mentioned, video content, original content, Prime Now, category expansion, investing on behalf of FBA, which also helps Prime devices. Those are all intertwined and certainly part of that. And then some of the things outside of that are more specifically related to International in addition to those are some of geographic stuff that we talked about. So I think you should think about it that way that certainly think its big opportunity and again, one of the reasons I want to give you an update, last quarter on Prime growth and you can see that that’s going very well. And so we're feeding that and that’s what we have been doing and that’s what you see also and certainly results that you are seeing today.
Colin Sebastian: Very helpful. Thanks very much.
Tom Szkutak: Sure.
