Operator: Your next question comes from Ron Josey with JMP Securities.
Ron V. Josey: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Just a quick follow-up on Heath's question, just on the price reductions. Brian, you said earlier in the year, can you just compare the reductions earlier this year versus the ones across the board and from last year in 2Q 2014? And then a follow up just on the third-party units I think you mentioned third-party units are now 45% or maybe 47% of total units. Is there a natural limit there or it doesn't matter as long as the customer experience through FBA is seamless? Thank you.
Brian T. Olsavsky: Hey Ron. So, I'll comment on the units first. We are really following the model of giving our customers as many choices as possible and letting them choose whether they want to buy first-party or third-party and I think we're working really hard to make sellers succeed on the platform. Brian touched on the success that our FDA sellers had with Prime Day, but we see FBA as a tailwind for third-party business in general. When we surveyed those sellers in the past, in 2014 about 71% of sellers saw a 20% or greater increase in sales when they entered the FBA program. So we are really happy with what that's doing for third-party business. We're working really hard to give customers as many options as possible and allowing them to choose. And we don't really have a specific target there. It all comes down to customer choice. On the price reduction question, we've got a long track record of driving costs out of the business and you can certainly see where we've even done that over the last several quarters if you look at the margins in AWS. We've also lowered prices for customers 49 times since launch and so it can be lumpy, but over the long haul that's the model we follow.
Ron V. Josey: Great. Thank you.
