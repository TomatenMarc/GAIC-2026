Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with UBS. Please proceed with your question.
Brent Thill: Thanks. Amy, in Q3 the Transactional business was weak, and you said that the business bounced back in Q4. Was that just a mere fact of you cleaning up some of the slipped business, or did you see additional strength on top of some of those closed transactions on the Transactional business in Q4?
Amy E. Hood: Thanks, Brent. Let me split your question into two components. The first thing really that I think Satya and I both focus on every quarter, every month, is how much of our business are we continuing to shift to annuity and specifically to the cloud. We structure all of our motions at this company, from how we engineer to how we do our go-to-markets to how we think about sales engagement to how we do our investments, fundamentally toward that long-term structural transition in the market. And so to your question on Transactional performance, there were some deals that didn't get done in Q3 that got done in Q4, and there were some deals done in Q4 on the Office side with large companies that I'm thrilled by. But at the same time, we still will focus on those deals moving to the cloud over time. And so this volatility that we are going to see because of macro and because of budget constraints, especially on Transactional, we will focus on because we expect excellent execution and have accountability to do that in the field. But our first priority, every time, is to make sure we are focused on annuity growth and digital transformation at our company, which is best done through that motion.
Brent Thill: Just to be clear, Amy, in terms of the sales motion, are they incented more towards cloud versus Transactional going into this year?
Amy E. Hood: Yes.
Satya Nadella: Absolutely.
Brent Thill: Thank you.
Chris Suh: Thanks, Brent. We'll move to the next question, please.
