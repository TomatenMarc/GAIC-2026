Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian from Robert Baird.
Colin Alan Sebastian: Great. Thanks. Mark, I wanted to ask a question on conversational interfaces, and specifically if we should think of Facebook becoming integrated as the skill app or feature on platforms such as Alexa, or should we think of things like Oculus, Messenger, and perhaps even a dedicated device as part of Facebook's own alternative platform? And then, Dave, just hoping you can put a finer point on the timing around the reduction in ad load growth. Thank you.
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg: I mean, to the first question, we're going to build the services that we think are useful. Some of them are going to be platforms and some of them are going to be apps and different things on top of platforms that other folks build. But fundamentally, we're trying to serve our community the best we can, and we'll do that across all these platforms.
David M. Wehner: Yeah. And in terms of ad load growth, I pointed to the fact that we continue to expect that ad load will be a less significant factor in the remainder of 2017, and that's certainly the case. That starts in Q3, but there's a number of other factors that I also pointed to, including the desktop lapping some of the efforts we made on desktop in terms of unblocking or working against the ad blocking technologies. And so, that has a factor on desktop growth. And then of course, I talked about video and our focus on driving and serving the consumer demand for video, and that's also leading to potentially lower impression growth as well.
