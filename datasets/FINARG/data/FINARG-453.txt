Operator: Our next question comes from line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
Heather Bellini: Great, thank you so much. Satya, I was wondering if you could share with us given the amazing XP refresh we’ve seen over the last 12 to 18 months, as you’re talking to customers, how do you feel about the corporate PC refresh cycle in calendar ‘15?
Satya Nadella: I think it will come back to the pre-XP business PC refresh. And so that’s what I think Amy’s comments also reflected and that’s what we expect to have happen in the rest of this fiscal year. The thing that Heather we are focused on is how do we make sure that not only do we -- the incremental value that we have today on Windows 8 gets adopted; there are in fact lots of use cases especially around field devices, mobile workforce where we are in fact seeing great adoption of Windows 8. But Windows 10 is something that’s completely optimized for the enterprise and across all same sizes for the mobile worker, as well as the desktop and large screens. Perhaps one of the most unique things about at least our portfolio and our innovation is that we think that it’s the mobility of the individual not the one device. That is important in the enterprise and that’s what we are building towards with great management and great security. And so we’re pleased with the early feedback we are getting from the first disclosure of Windows 10 and as well as some of the successes we are having with Windows 8 adoption in the enterprise. But the adoption I think will get back to a normal PC Refresh in the enterprise.
Heather Bellini: Thank you.
Satya Nadella: Thanks Heather.
Chris Suh: We’ll go to next question please.
