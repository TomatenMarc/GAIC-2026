Operator: Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.
Karl Keirstead: Amy, the commercial unearned revenue and bookings were again super strong, and evidently Microsoft is benefiting from fairly strong EA renewal activity. So, when you look out into fiscal ‘19, how would you compare the degree of renewal activity versus fiscal ‘18 and fiscal ‘17? It sounds like you’re still constructive, but I’d love to hear some color whether it feels as good as the fiscal year you just ended? Thank you.
Amy Hood: Thanks, Karl. Let me break up that question a little bit, because you actually asked a couple of things that are important. Number one, the unearned strength that we saw at the end of Q4, you’re right, was very good execution on renewals on a reasonably large renewal base. But, there was also very good execution of adding new workloads, adding new opportunity in Q4, things such as Azure, as an example or Dynamics 365, as an example. So, really Q4 wasn’t just renewal activity, it was also new workloads and new value. So, when you look into ‘19, I am optimistic on both of those fronts, good execution continuing on renewals as well as adding new value, new opportunity. And the third component of the question was really how did the renewal base correlate FY18? And the answer is, it’s a little bigger, but it actually has the same amount of volatility quarter-to-quarter, so Q1 renewal base is actually almost equivalent to last year.
