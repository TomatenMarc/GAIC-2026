Operator: At this time, we will now open up the call for questions. Thank you. Our first question comes from Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please state your question.
Douglas T. Anmuth: Thanks for taking the question. The International retail segment margin was the lowest we've seen in quite a while. I was hoping you could provide some of the key drivers there in terms of the drag and any color on how to think about the incremental international investment that might be impacting the 4Q guide. Thanks.
Brian T. Olsavsky: Sure. Thanks, Doug. Yes, specifically to International, we are seeing expansion to support selection, expansion at fulfillment network increases. We're also investing in digital content and additional Prime benefits, fresh location Prime Now. But by far the biggest individual thing is the investment in India that we continue to make and very excited about it, the initial reaction in India from both the customers and also sellers. So that is essentially the International margin guidance in Q4.
Douglas T. Anmuth: Thank you.
