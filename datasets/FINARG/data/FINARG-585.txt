Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Blackledge from Cowen.
John Blackledge: Two questions. How should we think about the video strategy on core Facebook? And any update on Watch users and engagement? And then on Instagram, there's been some discussion within the advertising community that Explore is an area for ad inventory expansion. Just any color on ad trends on the Explore tab.
Mark Zuckerberg: Yes. The video strategy is -- has been pretty consistent. We -- and it's consistent with the rest of what we're trying to do on creating these other tabs and social utilities as well. People watch a lot of video as part of News Feed. But what we also found was that just straight consuming a lot of video on News Feed was displacing some of the social interactions and connecting with people that was the real core of what people came to our services for.  So basically, in order for -- to fully meet the needs that people have for video, we started creating a separate tab, Watch, and that's been growing quickly as well. You can think about the content acquisition that we do there as more along the lines of either marketing or bringing new people into the experience. It's -- we're not building out a subscription service or anything like that around this. So that's more just some good examples of content and anchor content to help create the community and get people into that experience.
Sheryl Sandberg: I can share a little bit about the Explore opportunity. So more than 50% of accounts on Instagram are using Explore every month. And as of Q3, ads were available to 100% of advertisers. We think it's a great opportunity to reach customers who are already in a discovery mindset. And the way it works is after you click on a post in the Explore grid, you enter a Feed-like experience where the ads show up.
