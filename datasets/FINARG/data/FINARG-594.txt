Operator: The next question is from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Heather Bellini: Great, thank you. I just had a couple questions left. One, I was just wondering. Given your comments on the local and small business opportunity, I'm wondering what your view is on Facebook's potential role in the payment ecosystem and how that might evolve over time. And also, if you could, share with us how the rollout of Instagram Shopping, which people have started to talk about, how that might evolve over time as well. Thank you.
Sheryl K. Sandberg: In terms of payments, we really see payments as primarily a way to enforce the other activities we want to see on Facebook and Instagram. So payments enable advertisers to pay us. We are using payments in some of our other products in ways that enable some of the interactions we want to see. When we think about Instagram Shopping, it's very early tests, but it really follows the kinds of things we do in other areas of our products and services, like Messenger. What we see is that people in Instagram are using Instagram to browse for products and make those connections, and so we then make the product investments to make those a little bit easier. Similarly, to some of the things we've done in Messenger, some of the things we've done in Marketplace, we're watching for what is the organic activity between businesses and consumers, and then we're building products to enhance and enable that organic activity.
