Operator: Your last question comes from the line of Peter Stabler from Wells Fargo.
Peter C. Stabler: Thanks very much, one for Sheryl. Sheryl, you talked a lot about the targeting advantage of Facebook, and you have a number of data signals and sources informing that. I'm wondering if you could talk about the relative importance of collecting signals on the platform versus off the platform, for instance, the behavior of Facebook users interacting with third-party websites. Is this the depth of your off-platform collection? Is this a significant competitive advantage for you? Thank you very much.
Sheryl Kara Sandberg: We think that targeting end measurement are significant competitive advantages for us. We're very focused on the privacy of what people do, wherever they do it, and using the information we have in a very responsible way. We believe that because people are sharing interests, because people are themselves their real identity on the Facebook platform, we have a significant advantage just in basic targeting itself. Just age and gender, we're 38% more accurate than broad-based targeting according to Nielsen in the U.S., and that's just age and gender. And then if you think about some of the key studies I shared, targeting people who purchase a certain item, targeting people who are interested in a certain item, we think that's very substantial. We also think that there's a real competitive advantage in focusing on business results, as we have. We're really working on shifting people to understanding what their real objectives are so that they can focus on driving businesses. At the end of the day, when you show an ad, you want to move a product off a lot, off a shelf, into a shopping cart, whether it's online or offline, and that's where our focus is and will continue to be.
Deborah Crawford: Great, thank you again, everybody, for joining us today. We appreciate your time, and we look forward to speaking with you again.
