Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from analyst Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.
Jason Helfstein: Thank you. Can you talk a little bit about the dynamics in fourth quarter eCommerce, particularly in the US? Did we see more aggressive promotional activity and maybe talk about how you tried to work that to continue to drive the Prime number of members going forward? Thanks.
Brian Olsavsky: Sure. Well, what I can say is our approach to pricing has not changed. And through Q4 [ph] we did everything we could to have the best prices available for customers and in stock in time for the holiday. Another dynamic of Q4 was that it was a huge FBA quarter, nearly 50% of our third party units were FBA and our third party units were also up to 47% of our paid units, up 400 basis points year-over-year. So a really strong quarter for our FBA sellers using our FBA services. It did put a lot of demands on our warehouses and we were full. It was a very busy quarter and it did increase some of our variable costs as a result, primarily in the US, but a very strong quarter for FBA. It exceeded our - even our expectations.
Jason Helfstein: Perhaps how are you able to integrate that into holiday promotions?
Brian Olsavsky: I'm sorry. You cut off there. Could you repeat your question?
Jason Helfstein: Sure. Just any additional color around Prime and how you were able to integrate that into holiday promotions?
Brian Olsavsky: Nothing specific. I will say, you know, one interesting enhancement this year was our Prime Now service, which allowed people order in selected markets up until 11.59 on New Year, excuse me, Christmas Eve. So that was a valuable service to many late shoppers, last-minute shoppers.
