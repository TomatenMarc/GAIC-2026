Operator: Thank you. Your first question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Brian Nowak: Thanks for taking my questions, I have two. The first one, the past couple quarters you've given us a metric on the growth in time spent per user across the three big platforms. Any update at all on that around this quarter and what you're seeing? And then the second one, just on the Instagram Stories 100 million DAUs, any help at all on what the demographics or the age of those people look like? And how do you think about engagement of those users? Thanks.
David M. Wehner: I can take the first one, Brian, on the time spent metric. We're pleased with the growth in time spent per DAU that we're seeing across the Facebook family of apps. And that includes the Facebook mobile app, where we saw good year-over-year growth in time spent per DAU. Their video is making a big contribution to time spent growth, but we are not providing a specific stat on time spent growth on an ongoing basis.
Sheryl K. Sandberg: We're also not providing a specific breakdown of the DAU growth in Instagram Stories, but we're really excited about the engagement with the product and how it's growing across the board.
