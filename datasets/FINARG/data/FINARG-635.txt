Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs.
Heather Bellini: I just wanted to follow up on the Checkout on Instagram. And obviously you guys mentioned that you're rolling it out very slowly, which is understandable. I'm just wondering how much of this is due to the integration you need to have with the businesses' inventory system. And how are you going about the integration work that needs to be done to make the experience seamless, where you could kind of match inventory levels with what people are actually buying? And I guess the follow-up would be is there a benefit that you envision businesses getting from using this format versus one of your more traditional shopping ads?
Sheryl Sandberg: So, the integration you spoke of are the right ones we want. You want to be deeply integrated at a product level. It has to go all the way through for this to work from discovery, all the way through a pretty seamless checkout flow. And that's what we're working on, and that really takes time. You're also right that we are very focused on commerce ads on Facebook, that the great, great, great majority of activity is commerce ads on Facebook. We had a very strong holiday season. We continue to see growth across Facebook, across Instagram in people who are discovering products they're interested in, and we're continuing to make a lot of investments there.
