Operator: Our next question comes from Youssef Squali with Cantor Fitzgerald.
Youssef H. Squali: Thank you. I guess, another question on AWS if I may. So, I want to go back to something that you said, Brian. You said that you've seen greater efficiency in the business from a cost standpoint. I was wondering if you can maybe parse that out a little more for us. Were you referring to OpEx or CapEx? And if you're referring to CapEx as well, do you feel you that you have reached escape velocity that should allow CapEx as a percentage of revenues, pricing aside, to now allow you for a constant decline in that metric, CapEx as a percentage of revenue for that that particular business? Thanks.
Brian T. Olsavsky: What I can tell you is we have seen great efficiency on the cost side, the cost to generate the capacity for AWS. I will also say that Amazon is one of the primary large customers of AWS so we see it in the consumer side of the business as well, although that's not included in AWS revenue. It's an inter-company relationship. So, we get a double whammy there. We are getting great efficiency from our external AWS business but also from our own use of AWS services.
Youssef H. Squali: Okay thanks.
