Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Youssef Squali with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please proceed.
Youssef Squali: Great. Thank you very much. Two quick questions. First, can you quantify the contribution of PillPack acquisition in the quarter? Maybe help us understand the strategy there. And then there is some news, reports suggesting that you guys were working on an ad supported video streaming service under the IMDb brand. Can you just help shed any more light on that, is that especially relative to your Prime Video offering? Thank you very much.
Brian T. Olsavsky: Let me start with PillPack. The deal closed in September. So it wasn't a material impact on the quarter, but we're excited, really excited to start working with the management team there. They're very strong. They've done a great job building a highly differentiated customer experience, just customer-centric like we are. And right now our focus is on learning from them and innovating with them on how best to meet customer needs over time. I'll let Dave handle the second question.
Dave Fildes: Yeah. I think, I mean, we have no plans to build an ad-supported Prime Video offering for free at this time.
