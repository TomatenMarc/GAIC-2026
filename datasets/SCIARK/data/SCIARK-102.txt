‘Doing gender and gender equality’ through emotional expressions during a research interview.
Views of highly educated Swedish young adults
Abstract
The aim of this article is to contribute to the knowledge on how concepts of gender and gender equality are constructed within research interviews, deepening our understanding of the underlying gender system in society.
We focus on emotions and emotional processes expressed during interviews on work and family when specific questions originating in the World Value Survey were asked.
Our study is based on interviews with highly educated women and men, in two metropolitan areas of Sweden.
In this article, we seek to shed more light on how incorporating emotional expressions and the evaluation of these emotions can grasp the construction of gender and gender equality.
We highlight the range of emotional expressions that appear during the interviews, differences in their usage by women and men and the links to the construction of gender and gender equality.
We explore how the specific situation of the interview influences ‘doing gender and gender equality’ through emotions.
Our results reveal that men and women use similar but also different emotional expressions in conforming to the gender equality norm.
Men and women, interviewers and interviewees agreed on this norm, but the ways they ’performed’ the norm are gender based.
