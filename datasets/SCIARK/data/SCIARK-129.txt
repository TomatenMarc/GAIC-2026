Title: Good work ability among unemployed individuals: Association of sociodemographic, work-related and well-being factors
Aims: The aims of this study were to describe the perceived work ability of unemployed individuals and to explore the association between perceived good work ability and sociodemographic, work-related and well-being factors.
Methods: The data were derived from the Finnish Regional Health and Well-being Study (ATH) collected by postal and Internet-based questionnaires in 2014–2015.
The random sample was selected from the Finnish National Population Register.
The present study includes data from unemployed or laid-off respondents (n=1975) aged 20–65 years.
Logistic regression was used in the statistical analysis.
Perceived work ability was measured with the Work Ability Score.
Results: Factors significantly associated with good work ability were having young children living in the household, short-term unemployment, low or moderate physical strain in most recent job, moderate mental strain in most recent job, satisfaction with most recent job, good self-rated health and good quality of life.
Good self-rated health (odds ratio=10.53, 95% confidence interval 5.90–18.80) was the most substantial factor in the multivariate model.
Conclusions: The findings provide further evidence on the factors related to good work ability of the unemployed.
These factors should be considered when designing interventions for promoting work ability and to minimise the harmful effects of long-term unemployment.
