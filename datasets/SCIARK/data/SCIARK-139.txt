Estimation of changes in maternal mortality in a rural district of northern Tanzania during the last 50 years
Objective:                    Maternal mortality remains a major challenge worldwide.
Reliable information concerning ratios and trends is essential for resource mobilization and assessment of progress towards the Millennium Development Goals.
Design:                    Assessment of levels and trends in maternal mortality during the last 50 years.
Setting:                    Sengerema district, rural North Tanzania.
Population:                    Number of deliveries, births, admissions, maternal deaths and causes of maternal mortality in the only hospital in the area.
Methods:                    We compiled a database from the annual hospital reports for the period of 1962-2011 to obtain estimated maternal mortality ratio for each decade.
Main outcome measures:                    Maternal mortality ratio for each decade and classification of maternal deaths.
Results:                    Of 629 maternal deaths, 490 (77.9%) could be classified as either direct or indirect and causes of mortality ascertained.
Of the 361 direct causes (73.7%), hemorrhage (29.8%) and sepsis (20.4%) were the leading causes.
Of the 129 indirect causes (26.3%), anemia during pregnancy (6.5%), meningitis (4.1%), HIV-AIDS (3.5%), malaria (2.9%), heart diseases (2.4%) and relapsing fever (2.0%) were most often diagnosed.
Since 1962, a 63% decrease in maternal mortality ratio has been achieved.
The hospital-based maternal mortality ratio decreased from 770/100,000 to 282/100,000 in the last decade (95% confidence interval 244/100,000, 320/100,000).
The yearly decline since 1962 was 1.3%.
Conclusions:                    During the last 50 years we have witnessed a reduction of maternal mortality and improvements in maternal health.
Progress has been made towards improving Millennium Development Goal 5, although only a prospective population-based survey will provide the ultimate answer.
