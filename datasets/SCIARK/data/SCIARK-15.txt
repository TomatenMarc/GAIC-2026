Domestic violence against women in Turkey
Objective:
To identify the prevalence of domestic violence and the factors that influence domestic violence.
Methods:
A cross-sectional descriptive research design was used with data from 1481 women over 18 years of age who were married at least once.
Demographics and the Scale for Domestic Violence against Women (SDVAW) were used to collect the data.
Results:
The results showed that 41.3% of the women experienced domestic violence, and the majority (89.2%) had been subjected to violence by their spouses.
There was a significant relationship between the mean SDVAW score and educational status, income status, spouse’s age, spouse’s education level, marriage age, family type and subjection to violence (p<.05).
Conclusion:
Low social status in Turkey was connected to the level of domestic violence.
Efforts should be made to improve women’s social status.
Changing the country’s patriarchal system, and educating women and their spouses can be useful in preventing domestic violence.
