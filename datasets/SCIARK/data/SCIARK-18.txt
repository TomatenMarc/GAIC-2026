Male complications of female genital mutilation.
Female genital mutilation (FGM) is known to cause a wide range of immediate and long-term complications for women subjected to the practice.
Male complications due to FGM have, however, not been described before.
The objectives of this study were to explore male complications and attitudes with regard to FGM.
A village in the Gezira Scheme along the Blue Nile in Sudan constituted the basis of the study.
Interviews were carried out according to a pre-tested questionnaire, using structured questions with open-answer possibilities.
Married men of the youngest parental generation and grandfathers were randomly selected from up-to-date election lists.
All respondents except one agreed to be interviewed.
A total of 59 men were interviewed, 29 young men and 30 grandfathers.
Male complications resulting from FGM, such as difficulty in penetration, wounds/infections on the penis and psychological problems were described by a majority of the men.
Most men were also aware of the female complications.
More young than old respondents would have accepted a woman without FGM to become their daughter-in-law (p < 0.03).
A majority of the young men would have preferred to marry a woman without FGM.
This proportion was significantly higher than among the grandfathers (p < 0.01).
Female genital mutilation can no longer be considered to be only an issue for women.
The acknowledged male complications and attitudes described may open new possibilities to counteract the practice of FGM.
