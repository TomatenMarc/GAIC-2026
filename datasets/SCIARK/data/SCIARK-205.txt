GENDER EQUALITY and the GENDER GAP in MATHEMATICS
Abstract
A gender gap has been found in mathematics (boys outperform girls) that has prevailed across countries for many decades.
Whether this gap results from nature or nurture has been hotly debated.
Using the evidence of PISA 2003 and the gender equality index of 2003, some researchers have argued that an improvement in gender equality reduces the gender gap in mathematics.
This study used five waves of country-level PISA data and, controlling for country fixed effects, found no evidence to support this argument.
Furthermore, individual data for PISA 2012 and the multilevel data model were used.
The conclusion drawn also does not support the argument.
In fact, the relationship between gender equality and the gender gap in mathematics vanished after PISA 2003.
