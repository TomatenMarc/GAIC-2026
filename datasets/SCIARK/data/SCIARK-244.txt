Perceptions of gender equality in work-life balance, salary, promotion, and harassment: Results of the NASPGHAN task force survey
Abstract
Objectives: Gender equality in the workplace has not been described in pediatric gastroenterology.
Methods: An electronic survey that explored perceptions of career parity, work-life balance, and workplace harassment was sent to all members of the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition.
Reponses were anonymous.
Results: Of the 303 respondents (21%), there was an even distribution across geographic region, age, and gender (54% men).
Gender affected perception of salary and promotion; 46% of men but only 9% of women feel that "women earn the same as men" (P<0.001).
Similarly, 48% of men but only 12% of women feel that "women rise at the same rate as men" (P<0.001).
Both genders of academic practice respondents, compared with other practice models, perceived men were promoted more quickly than women (P=0.008).
Women had higher dissatisfaction with mentoring than men (29% vs 13%, P=0.03).
Significantly more men than women reported spouses with "flexible jobs" (35% vs 14%, P<0.001).
Having a spouse with "flexible job" or having children (preschool or school age), however, did not affect satisfaction with work-life balance for either gender.
Overall, women are more likely to be dissatisfied with work-life balance than men (P=0.046).
Conclusions: Satisfaction with work-life balance is lower among women versus men pediatric gastroenterologists, but does not correlate with flexibility of spouse's job or caring for young children.
Gender-divergent perception of promotion, parity of compensation, and mentoring requires further investigation.
