Effect of intimate partner violence on birth outcomes
Background: Violence by intimate partner during pregnancy has many adverse pregnancy outcomes.
Thus, that's why we sought to determine association between intimate partner violence during pregnancy and adverse birth outcomes.
Methods: A facility based cross-sectional study was conducted among 183 recently delivered women from March 31-April 30, 2014 in public health facilities of Hossana Town.
The data were collected through structured questionnaire and record review.
Women who were not mentally and physically capable of being interviewed and those admitted for abortion were excluded.
Ethical clearance was obtained from Jimma University.
Logistic regression analysis was employed to determine the association between intimate partner violence and adverse birth outcomes.
Results: About 23 % of women experienced intimate partner violence during pregnancy.
The result of this study indicated an association of intimate partner violence with low birth weight of the new born (AOR:14.3,95% CI: (5.03, 40.7).
Intimate partner violence was not associated with still birth, pre-term birth and Apgar score less than 7 at 5 minutes.
Conclusion: The findings of this study showed that intimate partner violence during pregnancy was associated with a low birth weight of the new born.
Health sectors should train health care providers on how to screen, counsel, treat and follow up abused women.
