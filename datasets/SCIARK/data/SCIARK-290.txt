Opinions of university students about female genital mutilation in Sudan
Background: Female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C) is an illegal tradition commonly practiced in Sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle East.
Despite a globalized world and developing social media, this harmful practice is currently still being implemented.
Aims: We aimed to evaluate the opinions of university students regarding FGM/C.
Methods: This descriptive study included 821 students who studied at Nyala University, Sudan, in January 2016.
The students were questioned for the following: age, faculty, reasons for female circumcision, effects of female circumcision on female sexual functions and their views about the circumcision for their daughter.
Results: The rate of FGM/C among female university students was 80.1%.
Although 73% of the male students prefer to marry uncircumcised women, they also reported that FGM/C should be continued to be performed, and their future daughters should be circumcised (64.5%).
Female students were against FGM/C for their future daughters (77.6%).
Conclusions: This study shows that even educated individuals demand FGM/C in spite of knowing the harm.
It is therefore suggested continuing educational studies on this subject
