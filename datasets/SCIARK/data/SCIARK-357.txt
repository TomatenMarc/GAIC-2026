Exploration and corrective measures of greenhouse gas emission from fossil fuel power stations for Bangladesh
Abstract:
Greenhouse gas emission is increasing alarmingly due to bulk electricity generation from fossil fuel such as coal, gas and oil with its limited stock.
While researchers are struggling to minimize the emission using suitable mitigation techniques including renewable energy sources, the Government of Bangladesh is implementing several Coal based power plants.
This paper presents mathematical model of parameters related to Greenhouse gas emission and demonstrates its emission rates resulting from various fuels used in Bangladeshi power plants.
The Greenhouse gas emission from the existing fossil fuel power plants using HOMER (Hybrid Optimization of Multiple Energy Resources) software is analyzed in this research.
The result shows that power plants of coal, diesel and natural gas emit 0.90 kg, 0.76 kg and 0.566 kg of CO2 per kWh, respectively.
Furthermore, several Greenhouse gas mitigating procedures are proposed for fossil fuel-based power generating stations.
