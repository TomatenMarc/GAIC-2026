Exergy Analysis of Chemical Processes
Abstract:
Exergy analysis (ExA) has been gaining relevance in the field of energy efficiency as a powerful tool to assess degradation of energy quality.
ExA quantifies the percentage of destroyed exergy via process irreversibilities, as well as the percentage of lost exergy via process deficiencies when handling waste (material and energy) streams.
ExA also assesses the primary sinks responsible for exergy destruction and/or exergy losses by process inefficiencies and/or design limitations.
Moreover, ExA might also be used as design criteria for optimization of process in order to minimize energy requirements, energy degradation and waste (material and energy) streams.
It is believed that a complete picture of the thermodynamic performance of a process is achieved and best evaluated by performing an exergy analysis in place of or in addition to conventional energy analysis.
This is due to the fact that ExA can clearly indicate the components or blocks that destroy or lose exergy the most, i.e., the most thermodynamically or materially inefficient components.
In this chapter, formulae for exergy flow rate of streams are obtained from application of first and second Laws of Thermodynamics together with conservation equations for the studied system (general steady-state open system and its reference environment).
