The casualties from electric bike and motorized scooter road accidents
Objective:                    The objective of this study was to describe demographic and injury characteristics of hospitalized injured patients involved in e-bike and motorized scooter accidents at a national level in Israel divided by different road user groups: riders and pedestrians.
Methods:                    This was a retrospective study based on data from the National Trauma Registry, between January 1, 2013, and December 31, 2015.
All hospitalized casualties due to the involvement of an e-bike or motorized scooter were included.
The type of hospitalized road user was further categorized and described by different variables.
Results:                    During the study period, the Israel Trauma Registry identified 795 hospitalized patients due to an e-bike or motorized scooter accident, with a dramatic 6-fold increase from 2013 to 2015.
Although the majority of the injured patients were riders, 8% were pedestrians.
Among the total casualties, 33% were children aged 0-14 years and among pedestrians 42% were children and 33% were seniors (ages 60+).
Five persons died in hospital, 3 riders and 2 pedestrians.
Conclusions:                    E-bike and motorized scooter riders represent the majority of patients hospitalized due to related traffic incident.
This finding questions the social and economic advantages of electric-powered 2-wheeled vehicles.
