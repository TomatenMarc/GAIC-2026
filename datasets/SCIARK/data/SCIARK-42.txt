The Analysis and Application of Energy-Internet in the Low-Carbon Community
The energy-Internet is a new energy supply method based on urban compact and densely populated community in a low-carbon city.
The principle is to connect small energy generation stations and combined heat and power system (CHP) based on distributed energy technology and renewable energy into a network in the urban district.
In this way, the cooling, heating and electricity could all back each other up.
Each building of the community could collect the energy and then put that energy into the energy-internet to supply the heating and power to buildings.
The power in the energy-internet could also be used for charging electric vehicles.
So the energy use in the urban community would be basically self-sufficient.
The energy generation stations in the energy-internet could be solar power, wind power, biomass cogeneration (including refuse power generation), household fuel cell, low-grade heat in rivers, lakes, urban sewage and soil.
In this way, large-scale renewable energy and unused energy could be fully used and applied in a compact and dense community.
If the energy-internet is suitable designed, the equipment capacity, energy consumption and CO2 emission of the community could be greatly reduced, energy efficiency could be optimized and improved and the heat island effect could also be alleviated.
This article explores three major problems of the construction of energy internet and their solutions: namely, the location and layout of the energy station, the environmental economic dispatch model of the energy internet with power dispatching as an example, the optimal path design of hot water pipe network combined with graph theory and genetic algorithms.
