Interventions to promote gender equality in the mining sector of South Africa
Abstract
This research study explored workplace challenges that women in the South African mining sector still face despite progressive gender sensitive regulations.
The purpose of the research was to come up with evidence-based recommendations on how to promote sustainable gender equality in South Africa's mining sector.
A survey approach was used for the research, with a total of 2 365 women working in the mining sector being interviewed.
The main challenge faced by the women was lack of career progress followed by discrimination in decision making and in remuneration.
Women attributed these challenges to their immediate supervisors and company policies.
A key lesson from the research was that legislation can be a useful tool in mitigating workplace challenges for women and reducing gender inequality in the mining sector but it is not a sufficient intervention.
The study recommends that deliberate steps should be taken to facilitate and impart skills to women that they need to progress up the employment level hierarchy.
This should be done while at the same time opening up opportunities of higher responsibilities for women to hold.
