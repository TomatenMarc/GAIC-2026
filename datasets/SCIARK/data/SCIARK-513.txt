Estimating utility value for female genital mutilation
Background Female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C) is a clear violation of women’s rights and can have adverse and irreversible health effects as well.
Worldwide, more than 200 million women and girls have undergone FGM/C.
Utility value of FGM/C has not been estimated yet, so we designed this study to extract the health utility value of FGM/C for the first time in the world.
Methods In a cross-sectional study in Iran, 125 girls and women who underwent FGM/C procedure were examined by the trained midwives in order to determine its type.
In addition, a questionnaire was completed for identifying the socio-demographic factors and extracting the health utility of these individuals.
Health utility was measured using Time Trade-off method and also to determine the effects of the socio-demographic factors on the health utility a two-limit censored regression model was applied.
Results The mean and median of the health utility of women with FGM/C were 0.971 (SE: 0.003) and 0.968 (IQR: 1–0.95), respectively.
Number of non-traders was 58 (46.4%) who reported perfect health utility.
However, the mean of health utility among traders was 0.946 (SE: 0.002).
Only type 1 (Clitoridectomy) and type 2 (Excision) FGM/C were seen in this study.
Women with Type 1 FGM/C had significantly lower health utility value (Mean: 0.968, Median: 0.957) than their type 2 counterparts (Mean: 0.987, Median: 1.00).
Moreover, women in the age group of 31–45 years (Mean: 0.962, Median: 0.956), single (Mean: 0.950, Median: 0.954), divorced (Mean: 0.951, Median: 0.950), employed (Mean: 0.959, Median: 0.956), and with supplementary insurance (Mean: 0.962, Median: 0.950) had significantly lower health utility than their counterparts.
Conclusion FGM/C affects physical and psychological well-being of these individuals, resulting in a lack of personal and marital satisfaction, which ultimately leads to a 3% reduction in their health related quality of life.
Therefore, preventing from this practice is very important and should be considered by health system policy makers more than before.
