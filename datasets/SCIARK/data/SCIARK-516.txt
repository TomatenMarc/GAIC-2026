The Impact of Lack of Clean Cooking Fuels on Sustainable Development in Developing Countries
Access to energy is crucial in tackling many of the current global development challenges that impact on people’s economic, health and social well-being as well as the ability to meet the commitments of reducing carbon emissions through clean energy use.
Despite increased attention from multiple governments and agencies, energy poverty remains a serious sustainable development issue in many developing countries.
To date, most research have focused on general access to electricity and the generation of clean energy to replace fossil fuels, failing to address the lack of basic access to clean energy for cooking and heating.
More people in the world lack access to clean cooking fuels than to electricity.
This issue is one aspect of a broader research which investigates the impacts of optimized energy policy and energy business models on sustainable development in developing countries.
