Resistance in rejecting solid fuels: Beyond availability and adoption in the structural dominations of cooking practices in rural India
Abstract
Solid fuels are the primary cooking fuels in a wide range of developing countries, a situation that is projected to remain for the coming few decades.
In the energy poverty scholarship, it is a well-argued concept that social systems influence people’s energy choices.
Influenced by theories of Practice, this study explores the role that social structure plays in the perpetuation of the use of solid cooking fuels, with a particular focus on rural India.
We employ a qualitative approach of inquiry for data collection in three villages in Chittoor district in the state of Andhra Pradesh.
The results presented in this paper are based on in-depth household interviews and focus group discussions.
The findings suggest that cooking with solid fuels is intertwined with structural elements, such as established traditions, traditional income generating practices, gender norms, and a sense of belonging.
These factors profoundly dominate households’ decisions to continue using solid fuels despite the availability and the adoption of modern alternatives.
The paper argues that interventions targeted at reducing the use of solid fuels may fail if they: 1) focus only on supplying modern fuels; 2) do not consider contextual social barriers; and 3) are implemented as standalone projects.
