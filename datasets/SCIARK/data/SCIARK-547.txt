Changes in Sexual Distress, Depression and Sexual Function after Clitoral Reconstruction in Women with Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting
Abstract Background: Female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C) links health complications and psychological distress.
However, there is scarce literature on how women with FGM/C respond to treatment interventions.
Objective: In this study, we aimed to assess changes in depression symptomatology, sexual function, and distress following clitoral reconstructive surgery combined with a psychoeducational intervention.
Methods: The reconstructive surgery consisted of recovering the remaining clitoris and placing it externally and as close to the vagina as possible.
FGM/C patients (n = 27) received psychological support and sexual counseling upon undergoing the surgical intervention and were further assessed at 6-month follow-up.
Moreover, they completed the Beck Depression Inventory and the Female Sexual Distress Scale Revised at these two time points.
Patients’ sexual dysfunction was assessed according to DSM-5 criteria.
Results: Statistically significant clinical changes after FGM/C were reported.
Overall, patients presented reduced depression and sexual distress levels, and decreased female sexual interest/arousal disorder prevalence.
Results also revealed that sexual distress improvements were more significant in Type I FGM/C patients.
Conclusions: Significant improvements in sexual distress, psychopathology, and sexual function were observed in our sample following reconstructive surgery, suggesting that combined interventions are effective for treatment.
