Emissions mitigation by infrastructure improvement and increased renewables share on electricity grid
Abstract:
In order to foster the development of the nations, it is of high importance to have a holistic approach towards sustainability, particularly the implementation of the UN 2030 Agenda of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is the key and, when it comes to energy, the grid infrastructure plays a key role to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all (SDG 7) as it is stated by indicators 7.b; “By 2030, expand infrastructure and upgrade technology for supplying modern and sustainable energy services for all”; 7.b.1; “Investments in energy efficiency as a proportion of GDP and the amount of foreign direct investment in financial transfer for infrastructure and technology to sustainable development services”.
In this line, the aim of this study is to clarify the potential of emissions reduction through decreasing transmission and distribution losses in national grids in developing states, where the issue of losses within the grid is much more severe than in more developed economies.
The study was carried out using the Integrated Assessment Model MESSAGE and the region studied involve India, sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, South America, where the grid deficiencies are larger than 11%.
Two main scenarios are simulated with different penetrations of renewables to the grid and compared with the “Business as Usual” case.
The essential, direct investment needed for the grid infrastructure improvement is provided by developed nations and the propagation of CO2 emissions are reported.
Simulating those different scenarios will assist in the quantification of the environmental impact as well as to policy implementation.
