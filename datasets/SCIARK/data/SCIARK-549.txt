Scaling-Up Sustainable Renewable Energy Generation from Municipal Solid Waste in the African Continent: Lessons from eThekwini, South Africa
The three processes of urbanization, industrialization and globalization are positively correlated with municipal solid waste generation and energy consumption in global urban centers.
Heavy reliance on fossil fuels in most world cities has contributed not only to global warming and climate change, but also to astronomical increases and volatility in the prices of energy sources.
Africa has suffered from energy shortages and climate change as well, for it depends on very limited oil reserves and on finite, toxic coal resources.
Thus, the need for innovation in renewable energy generation is more urgent now than ever.
Africa is home to many renewable energy sources, ranging from sun and water to municipal solid waste and wind.
This article discusses the conversion of waste to energy in the eThekwini municipality, a South African metropolis, and describes prospects for implementing a similar model in other African countries.
The study unearths cutting-edge work by the Department of Cleansing and Solid Waste of eThekwini municipality, which has adopted modern municipal solid waste management and treatment systems.
For almost a decade now, the municipality has demonstrated the potential for African cities to achieve two primary objectives: first, to generate clean renewable energy sources that contribute to economic development, and second, to reduce urban social and environmental problems resulting from improper waste disposal.
The municipality’s success also reveals tremendous opportunities to improve waste management, financial investments, technological take-up, and skillsets to support the African green energy revolution.
