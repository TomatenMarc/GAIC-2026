Organ donation in suicides
Introduction:                    There are few reports in the literature analyzing brain death epidemiology in suicides, or the rate of donation and family authorization in such situations.
Objective:                    The objectives of this study were to analyze the frequency of suicide as a cause of brain death and to compare the donation rates among this population with other causes of brain death.
Patients and methods:                    We reviewed records from 2627 potential donors between 1988 and 2004.
Results:                    Within that period, 101 (3.8%) cases of brain death were recorded as suicides.
The mean age was significantly lower (P < .05) in cases of suicide than for other causes (26.2 + 11.1 vs 34.4 + 16.5 years); there was a male prevalence (76.2% vs 60.8%).
As to suicides, the donation rate was significantly higher than in other situations (62.3% vs 43.8%).
This was due to a lower rate of negative family responses (17.8% vs 32.1%).
Conclusions:                    Suicide is a frequent cause of brain death (3.8%), mainly among young men.
The donation rate in this group is higher than that due to other causes of death because of a lower negative response rate by the family.
The explanation remains to be clarified for such a low refusal rate for organ donation by the relatives of potential donors due to suicide.
