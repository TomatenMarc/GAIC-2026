A multicentre study on knowledge and attitude of nurses in northern Nigeria concerning female genital mutilation
Abstract Objective To determine the knowledge and attitude of nurses in northern Nigeria concerning female genital mutilation (FGM).
Methods Cross-sectional study in which 350 nurses working in three tertiary health institutions in northern Nigeria were assessed, using a self-administered questionnaire, with regard to their knowledge of, and attitude to, FGM.
Results Two hundred and sixty-five respondents (76%) were female, 190 (54%) were married.
Most (249; 71%) were Muslims, and 228 (65%), of Hausa/Fulani ethnicity.
Their ages ranged from 18–60 years with a mean of 29.3 ± 8.9.
Among the respondents, 318 (91%) had heard of FGM; of these 127 (40%) knew no particular type of FGM.
Only 155 (49%) could identify ‘Angurya’ and ‘Gishiri’ cuts as forms of FGM.
Two hundred and forty-five (77%), 231 (73%) and 200 (63%), respectively, identified haemorrhage; risk of HIV, hepatitis, and tetanus; and painful sexual intercourse as possible complications of FGM.
Thirteen (4%) would perform it and also would have it done on their daughters.
Conclusion The nurses studied had a high level of awareness of FGM and a good general knowledge of complications associated with FGM.
However, only half knew what ‘Angurya’ and ‘Gishiri’ cuts were.
A few would perform FGM.
