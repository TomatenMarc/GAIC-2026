Gender equality and women's participation in transport cycling
Abstract
Population-level health benefits are associated with cycling as a means for day-to-day travel.
Several factors inhibit women's participation in transport cycling.
The aim of the present study was to investigate the relationship between gender equality using the composite indicator of Gender Equality Index and its six core domains (work, money, knowledge, time, power, and health) plus violence and women's participation in transport cycling across the 28 member states of the European Union.
The gross domestic product was included as a controlling variable.
Results showed that the composite indicator of Gender Equality Index was associated with women's participation in transport cycling as well as with gender differences in participation in transport cycling.
The core domains of health and work were not related to women's participation in transport cycling.
Women's participation in transport cycling was associated with the following domains: time, power, and violence.
The effect of gender equality varied across different indicators, with the strongest effect size found for time.
The traditional sexual division of labour (gender gaps in caring and educating children or grandchildren, as well as in cooking and housework) may inhibit women's participation in transport cycling.
