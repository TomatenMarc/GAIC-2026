Concept of Culture Relativism and Women’s Rights in Sub-Saharan Africa
Abstract
This article discusses the challenges of the realization of women’s rights in relation to the concept of culture relativism in sub-Saharan Africa.
It examines how the concept of culture is misconstrued with a traditional hierarchy and patriarchy approach that intervenes in the realization of women’s rights in sub-Saharan African states.
Many societies are concerned that the promotion of gender equality would interfere with local culture; hence they feel that gender equality should not be promoted for ethical reasons.
Women have been left with the unpleasant situation of choosing between their rights or their culture.
Through secondary analysis and a critical review of the literature, the article engages in the debate on cultural diversity and gender equality, to challenge the existing stereotypes in sub-Saharan African cultures.
It argues that traditional and cultural practices should adhere to the values of equality and human rights.
The article proposes that cultural considerations will have to yield whenever a clear conflict with human rights norms becomes apparent.
