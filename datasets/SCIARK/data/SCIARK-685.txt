Gender differences in response to competition with same-gender coworkers: A relational perspective.
AbstractWe take a relational perspective to explain how women and men may differently experience competition with their same-gender coworkers.
According to gender socializationresearch, the female peer culture values harmony and the appearance of equality, while hierarchical ranking is integral to the male peer culture.
As competition dispenses with equality and creates a ranking hierarchy, we propose that competition is at odds with the norms of female (but not male) peer relationships.
On this basis, we predicted and found in one correlational study and three experiments thatwomen regardcompetition with their same-gender coworkersas less desirable than men do, and their relationships with each other suffer in the presence of competition.
We discuss the implications of these findings for women’s career progression.
