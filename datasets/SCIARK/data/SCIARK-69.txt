Leading global energy and environmental transformation: Unified ASEAN biomass-based bio-energy system incorporating the clean development mechanism
In recent years, the ten member countries in the Association of Southeast Asia Nations (ASEAN) have experienced high economic growth and, in tandem, a substantial increment in energy usage and demand.
Consequently, they are now under intense pressure to secure reliable energy supplies to keep up with their growth rate.
Fossil fuels remain the primary source of energy for the ASEAN countries, due to economic and physical considerations.
This situation has led to unrestrained emissions of greenhouse gases to the environment and thus effectively contributes to global climate change.
The abundant supply of biomass from their tropical environmental conditions offers great potential for ASEAN countries to achieve self-reliance in energy supplies.
This fact can simultaneously transform into the main driving force behind combating global climate change, which is associated with the usage of fossil fuels.
This research article explores the potential and advantages for ASEAN investment in biomass-based bio-energy supply, processing and distribution network with an emphasis on regional collaborations.
It also investigates the implementation and operational challenges in terms of political, economic and technical factors for the cross-border energy scheme.
Reliance of ASEAN countries on the clean development mechanism (CDM) to address most of the impediments in developing the project is also under scrutiny.
Unified co-operation among ASEAN countries in integrating biomass-based bio-energy systems and utilising the clean development mechanism (CDM) as the common effort could serve as the prime example for regional partnerships in achieving sustainable development for the energy and environmental sector in the future.
