Improving suicide mortality statistics in Tarragona (Catalonia, Spain) between 2004-2012
Introduction: Monitoring and preventing suicidal behaviour requires, among other data, knowing suicide deaths precisely.
They often appear under-reported or misclassified in the official mortality statistics.
The aim of this study is to analyse the under-reporting found in the suicide mortality statistics of Tarragona (a province of Catalonia, Spain).
Method and materials: The analysis takes into account all suicide deaths that occurred in the Tarragona Area of the Catalan Institute of Legal Medicine and Forensic Sciences (TA-CILMFS) between 2004 and 2012.
The sources of information were the death data files of the Catalan Mortality Register, as well as the Autopsies Files of the TA-CILMFS.
Suicide rates and socio-demographic profiles were statistically compared between the suicide initially reported and the final one.
Results: The mean percentage of non-reported cases in the period was 16.2%, with a minimum percentage of 2.2% in 2005 and a maximum of 26.8% in 2009.
The crude mortality rate by suicide rose from 6.6 to 7.9 per 100,000 inhabitants once forensic data were incorporated.
Small differences were detected between the socio-demographic profile of the suicide initially reported and the final one.
Supplementary information was obtained on the suicide method, which revealed a significant increase in poisoning and suicides involving trains.
Conclusions: An exhaustive review of suicide deaths data from forensic sources has led to an improvement in the under-reported statistical information.
It also improves the knowledge of the method of suicide and personal characteristics.
