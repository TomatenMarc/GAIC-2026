Gender Differences in Anxiety and Depression before and after Alcohol Detoxification: Anxiety and Depression as Gender-Related Predictors of Relapse
Abstract
Background/aims: The aim of this prospective study was to estimate gender differences in anxiety, depression, and alcohol use severity among patients with alcohol use disorder (AUD) before and after detoxification program and within 12 months after discharge.
Methods: AUD severity, state and trait anxiety, and depression were assessed in 187 patients entering an inpatient alcohol detoxification program.
Follow-up assessments were performed at 6 and 12 months after discharge.
A between- and within-subjects analyses explored gender differences.
The predictive value of anxiety and depression for alcohol relapse was analyzed by logistic and linear regression in both genders.
Results: Females had higher levels of anxiety and depression than males both at admission and after discharge.
Trait anxiety and depression significantly increased 6 months after discharge in males and females respectively.
Both state and trait anxiety levels at the 6-month follow-up predicted alcohol relapse at the 12-month follow-up in males.
Conversely, in females, depression level at the 6-month follow-up was a predictor of relapse at the 12-month follow-up.
Conclusions: In both genders, the psychopathological dimension that showed the most significant worsening at 6-month follow-up (i.e., anxiety in males and depression in females) was found to be a significant predictor of relapse at the 12-month follow-up.
