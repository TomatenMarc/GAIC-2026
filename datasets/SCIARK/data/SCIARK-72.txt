Framing Social Inclusion as a Benchmark for Cycling-Inclusive Transport Policy in Kisumu, Kenya
Cycling in many cities of the Global South faces unending exclusion from street spaces despite the on-going transport policy reforms.
This exclusion worsens the marginalisation of the poor majority who use this mode.
In this paper, we formulate social inclusion as a policy tool for reconciling transport policy to the cycling needs of Kisumu, Kenya.
We draw from social quality theory and Lefebvre’s right to the city concept to assemble the ideals of social inclusion.
These ideals form the benchmark for a qualitative content analysis of the policy pronouncements contained in the Kenya Vision 2030 and the Integrated National Transport Policy to ascertain the opportunities presented by these policies for cycling inclusion.
Findings from interviews held with transport professionals in government and private practice support this content analysis.
Results show that while the Kenya Vision 2030 focuses on economic growth, the Government has prioritised the implementation of its projects, thus diminishing the fragile opportunity for cycling inclusion presented by the transport policy.
To consolidate this opportunity, we propose different policy recommendations to improve the terms for cyclists to claim and produce street spaces.
