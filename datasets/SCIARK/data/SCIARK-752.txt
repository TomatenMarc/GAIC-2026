Representation of Women on Radiology Journal Editorial Boards: A 40-Year Analysis
Abstract
Rationale and objectives: We examined female representation on editorial boards of four prominent radiology journals.
We compared editorial board representation to female academic radiology career advancement and the proportion of female authorship in three journals over four decades.
Methods: We collected data on the gender of editorial board members as listed on mastheads of Radiology, American Journal of Roentgenology (AJR), Academic Radiology, and the Journal of the American College of Radiology in 5-year intervals plus the most recent year available (1973-2017), and the gender of their editors-in-chief for all years since each journal's inception.
We compared Radiology, AJR, and Academic Radiology data to published data on gender of the journals' authors, all US medical students, and academic radiologists over time.
Results: Gender was determined for 171 editors-in-chief (100%) and 2139 (100%) editorial board members listed in the selected journals for each of the study years.
The proportion of women on editorial boards increased from 1.4% (1 of 69) in 1978 to 18.8% (73 of 388) in 2013 (P < .001), but remained below the proportion of female first authors (7.5% in 1978 and 27.1% in 2013) and female faculty in radiology (11.5% in 1978 and 28.1% in 2013).
None of the four general radiology journals had a female editor-in-chief during the study period.
Conclusions: Female representation on editorial boards has increased over time, but still lags behind increases seen in female first authorship in radiology journals and radiology faculty appointments over the last four decades.
There was no female editor-in-chief during the study period.
