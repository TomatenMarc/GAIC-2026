Men and women in positions of responsibility: A qualitative analysis of organizational readiness in France and Finland
Abstract
This paper examines whether male and female managers hold different opinion on women in managerial and higher level positions, depending on their different cultural background.
Furthermore, the paper deals with managers’ perception of organizational readiness to accept women in managerial positions.
The paper is looking at this aspect from a cultural perspective, by comparing France to Finland.
The research is based on 16 interviews, 9 from France and 7 from Finland, with individuals in different managerial positions in 10 private companies located in both countries.
Findings indicate that regardless of the country and of the cultural backgrounds, organizations are not ready to let women climb the hierarchical ladder as men do.
Results also show that despite a positive mind-set toward gender-equality, Finnish women still face a strong masculine corporate culture.
