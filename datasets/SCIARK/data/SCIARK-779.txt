Analysis of suicide mortality in Brazil: spatial distribution and socioeconomic context
Objective: To perform a spatial analysis of suicide mortality and its correlation with socioeconomic indicators in Brazilian municipalities.
Methods: This is an ecological study with Brazilian municipalities as a unit of analysis.
Data on deaths from suicide and contextual variables were analyzed.
The spatial distribution, intensity and significance of the clusters were analyzed with the global Moran index, MoranMap and local indicators of spatial association (LISA), seeking to identify patterns through geostatistical analysis.
Results: A total of 50,664 deaths from suicide were registered in Brazil between 2010 and 2014.
The average suicide mortality rate in Brazil was 5.23/100,000 population.
The Brazilian municipalities presenting the highest rates were Taipas do Tocantins, state of Tocantins (79.68 deaths per 100,000 population), Itaporã, state of Mato Grosso do Sul (75.15 deaths per 100,000 population), Mampituba, state of Rio Grande do Sul (52.98 deaths per 100,000 population), Paranhos, state of Mato Grosso do Sul (52.41 deaths per 100,000 population), and Monjolos, state of Minas Gerais (52.08 deaths per 100,000 population).
Although weak spatial autocorrelation was observed for suicide mortality (I = 0.2608), there was a formation of clusters in the South.
In the bivariate spatial and classical analysis, no correlation was observed between suicide mortality and contextual variables.
Conclusion: Suicide mortality in Brazil presents a weak spatial correlation and low or no spatial relationship with socioeconomic factors.
