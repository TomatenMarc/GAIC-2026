Financing Clean Technology Innovation and the Transition to Renewable Energy
Abstract:
We outline the need to invest in clean technology innovation and the peculiar difficulties in financing research and development in this sector.
The renewable energy portion of the cleantech industry could be characterized as asset-heavy, high-risk, low-return with a long development cycle, exacerbating financing difficulties.
This chapter surveys financing options, differentiating between the financing requirements of technology development and asset deployment.
The interplay between the fossil fuel and the renewable energy sectors creates challenges and opportunities, and the role of subsidies for the consumption of fossil fuel and the production of renewable energy makes investment returns very sensitive to policy shifts.
We outline the potentially positive role of new financing instruments as well as corporate investment by oil majors.
