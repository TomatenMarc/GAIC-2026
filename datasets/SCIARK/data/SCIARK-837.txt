The Impact of COVID-19 on Women
Action, was intended to be ground-breaking for gender equality.
Instead, with the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic even the limited gains made in the past decades are at risk of being rolled back.
The pandemic is deepening pre-existing inequalities, exposing vulnerabilities in social, political and economic systems which are in turn amplifying the impacts of the pandemic.
Across every sphere, from health to the economy, security to social protection, the impacts of COVID-19 are exacerbated for women and girls simply by virtue of their sex: > Compounded economic impacts are felt especially by women and girls who are generally earning less, saving less, and holding insecure jobs or living close to poverty.
> While early reports reveal more men are dying as a result of COVID-19, the health of women generally is adversely impacted through the reallocation of resources and priorities, including sexual and reproductive health services.
> Unpaid care work has increased, with children out-of-school, heightened care needs of older persons and overwhelmed health services.
